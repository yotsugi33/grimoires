<p class="indent"><span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n came to earth by virtue of the <i>ak<span class="small">&#242;</span>ko</i> tree (<i>Newbouldia laevis</i>), a tree sacred not only to him, but also to Eg<span class="small">&#250;</span>ng<span class="small">&#250;</span>n and <span class="small">&#7864;</span>gb<span class="small">&#x00eb;</span>. It is frequently used in rites of initiation to <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n and any of the spirits associated with hunting and in childbirth, as it possesses the property of facilitating delivery and expelling the placenta. This tree was found in the city of Oko. The centre of the cult of <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n is the city of Ir<span class="small">&#233;</span>, although it was in Oko that he first manifested. We find an interesting play on words and place here that will help us understand <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n better with <i>ok<span class="small">&#243;</span></i> (the penis), <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>k<span class="small">&#242;</span></i> (a projectile) and <i>ok<span class="small">&#243;</span> <span class="small">&#237;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span>n</i> (the trigger of a gun).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>nd<span class="small">&#225;</span> imparts that <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n suddenly appeared on earth. This is related to other stories that speak of him not having a mother or father, but of being adopted. These are themes that indicate the presence of <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> and not a human being. The conditions surrounding <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>nd<span class="small">&#225;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s arrival on earth, are meticulously detailed by Osamoro in <i>Ifism</i> (1986). This account speaks of how <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>nd<span class="small">&#225;</span> had to run from <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run after accidently watching Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span> eating; to watch the owner of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run engaged in this activity was a huge taboo. Consequently <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>nd<span class="small">&#225;</span> ran away from <a id="page_232"></a><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run, snatching one of Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s flags with him as he went to descend into a womb of his choice. He chose to be born in circumstances in which he could express <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>nd<span class="small">&#225;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> in the best ways. Hence he was born in the form of <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n incarnates <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>nd<span class="small">&#225;</span> on earth. <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>nd<span class="small">&#225;</span> represents virility and creativity in the guise of the first blacksmith, who forged tools to clear paths in the wilderness and to hunt, tools also used for warfare. <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n forged the spine that enabled the human being, whom <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> had created, to stand erect and gain muscles and strength. <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n became the father of fire and he shares the compulsiveness and tendency of destruction found in the passionate essence of fire. <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>nd<span class="small">&#225;</span> opened the way for soldiers, butchers and thieves. As the first blacksmith, he also became the first surgeon, a trade ruled by intellect, creativity and metal, and so became associated with the force that cuts the umbilical cord and enables the infant<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s journey on earth to begin.</p>
<p class="indent">This <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> holds the power of making roads in the wilderness, in reference to finding a solution even if the situation appears to be impossible. It is a power that brings fast results, because <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>nd<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> moves with the enthusiasm of fire. <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n is represented by any weapon and any product forged by a blacksmith. Palm wine, <i>efun</i> (white chalk), <i>obi</i> (kola nut), gin, roosters, snails, turtles, dogs and roasted yams are amongst his favourite food and drink, together with <i>oguro</i> (the palm wine from the pako tree); whilst he is antagonistic towards <i>ejo</i> (snake), <i>adin</i> (palm kernel oil) and <i>adie</i> (hen). His preferences tell us of <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>nd<span class="small">&#225;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i>; so we should take notice of the loyalty of dogs, and the help they can provide in hunting; the hard shell of the tortoise and snail, and their longevity; and how these three animals are attributed to <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>nil<span class="small">&#233;</span> (the spirit of earth), <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span>ny<span class="small">&#236;</span>n (the spirit of medicine) and <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> (the spirit of purity and calmness). We should observe how <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n rejects <i>adin</i>, the oil made from the sacred <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>k<span class="small">&#237;</span>ns</i> of If<span class="small">&#225;</span>, which represents ignorance; and the energy of snakes, which symbolizes betrayal. By analyzing the sacrificial items benign to a power and its taboos we can gain an idea of the essence of a given energy. Here we have an energy that is steady and calm, directed towards healing and wisdom, but the presence of alcohol denotes a fire that adds to a force that is already the source of fire. As a result, strength and courage can become boastful and ill directed.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>nd<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> speaks of how a road was opened between <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run and Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span>, to provide the invisible and visible world with a means of communication. It signals the beginning of order and organization in social communities. Another consequence <a id="page_233"></a>of the road being opened was the arrival of all good things in the world, but obstructing forces also entered by the same route; human society welcomed both.</p>
<p class="indent">The <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> tells how <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> and <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> discovered that the guardian of good fortune was a cripple placed at the junction between <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run to Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span>. When they found this guardian asleep there, they began to summon all good fortune to descend upon the earth. After they had spread good fortune across the earth, the spirits descended. One group, in particular, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> wanted to bring to earth; these were all students of If<span class="small">&#225;</span> and were said to bear horns on their heads. This group of students were inclined to mischief. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> wanted to give these beings a chance to experience good fortune, so he gave them a task. He set eight rules that should not be broken. He told them that if they accomplished this, and refrained from what was forbidden, they would not only reap good fortune and joy, but they would also become powers of fortune for others. They accepted his terms. But upon entering the world they announced to <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> that each and every promise had been broken. And so it happened that the Ab<span class="small">&#236;</span>wo K<span class="small">&#x025A;</span>nk<span class="small">&#x025A;</span> opened for the arrival of the spirits that we know as <i>ajog<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i> to come to earth. There is more to this story, but this should suffice to explain how the spirits of conflict, misfortune and suffering came to earth and how they called upon the spirits of <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i>, which will be detailed in the next <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, to follow suit in order to work upon the passions of men.</p>
<p class="indent">In <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>nd<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>, we find the story of the second attempt to turn Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span> into a suitable habitat for human beings. The story goes that <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n was appointed to lead this second attempt. He was accompanied by 400 spirits who would inhabit the world, but <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n did not make any <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span></i> or consult with If<span class="small">&#225;</span> before going, he relied solely upon his own strength and cunning. When they arrived on earth, the 400 <i><span class="small">&#232;</span>n<span class="small">&#236;</span>y<span class="small">&#224;</span>n</i> he brought with him became hungry, but he had no food to offer them except for the bark of trees, and so they started to slowly die of starvation. <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n went back to <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run and declared the task impossible. Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span> then sent Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>kun, another self assured and proud <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#7865;</span></i>, who was also given 400 <i><span class="small">&#232;</span>n<span class="small">&#236;</span>y<span class="small">&#224;</span>n</i>, 200 men and 200 women. Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>kun did not make any <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span></i> or consult with If<span class="small">&#225;</span> and thus came equally unprepared to earth. When they arrived, the <i><span class="small">&#232;</span>n<span class="small">&#236;</span>y<span class="small">&#224;</span>n</i> that came with him became hungry, but he had only water to offer them and so they started to die. Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>kun returned to heaven, declaring the task impossible.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> was then given the task. Seeing the failure of <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n and Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>kun, he decided to proceed with caution, and asked his faithful companion <span class="small">&#210;</span>p<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>l<span class="small">&#x0275;</span> (the <a id="page_234"></a>divining chain) what he should do. <span class="small">&#210;</span>p<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>l<span class="small">&#x0275;</span> advised him to bring a variety of seeds and plants and foods to earth, and told him that he should also make a sacrifice to <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> so that he could follow him on his mission. Hearing about this, <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> went to <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n and Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>kun, telling them that <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> was about to travel to earth. <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n ran to the crossroads of heaven and caused a thick forest to grow in the path he had made from <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run to Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span> in order to hinder <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>. As <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> came to the crossroads of heaven, <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n challenged him, but after some discussion, allowed <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> to pass, on the condition that he would support the few followers of <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n that remained alive and feed them with trees and greenwood. As <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> started to descend, Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>kun challenged him, closing the path with waters, but that complication was resolved, as <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> promised Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>kun that he would find sources of nutrition and water for his devotees on earth too. When he arrived on earth, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> instructed his followers to make straw huts, plant the seeds, and place the animals he had brought in places fertile with greenwood. From one day to the next, the seeds gave forth harvest and the animals produced young. It was a miracle. Soon enough, the followers of <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n and Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>kun appeared, searching for food, but they were first given sticks to chew on and water to drink and it is in memory of this story we all begin the day with chewing sticks to clean our teeth and rinsing our mouths with water.</p>
<p class="indent">It so happened that <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> completed his task. He fed his people and expanded their lands, but as they were increasing he told <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> to go to heaven and bring back his faithful wife <span class="small">&#210;</span>p<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>l<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>. <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> did as he was bid, only to find upon returning to earth that a hut had been made for him in his absence and that his favourite foods were waiting for him there. <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> danced in joy and praised <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> and his kindness, promising loyalty to him.</p>
<p class="indent">Seeing that <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> did not return to heaven, <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n and Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>kun became curious, and decided to go to earth to check up on what was going on. At the crossroads of the earth they met <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>, who told them of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s success.

<p class="indent"><a id="page_237"></a>The <i>iy<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> tree (<i>Daniellia oliveri</i>, also known as the African Copaiba Balsam tree or Gum Copal) came to earth in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. It is used for incense and the oil that protects and shines wood. The gum wards off mosquitoes and is a protection against bad luck and malefica. The tree has a variety of medicinal uses: it is diuretic, a painkiller and a bactericide, and used to treat everything from depression to venereal diseases and menstrual pain. It symbolizes the ascent from poverty to wealth, and is related to finding solutions to any situation. <i>I<span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#236;</span>n</i> (<i>Crotolaria retusa</i>) is a complicated plant found in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, representing loss of fortune, as is <i>kanranj<span class="small">&#225;</span>ngb<span class="small">&#243;</span>n</i> (<i>Soleanum sisymbriifolium</i> and related species) which is reputed to steal people<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s luck.

<p class="indent"><a id="page_240"></a>This <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> is about patience and strength, as shown by the lion, but also recognizing that this is not always sufficient. By taking the shape of the wind, <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> sabotages the success of the lion in order to teach him the lesson of humility. It stresses the importance of recognizing that the world is a mysterious place, that our success is never only our own. The lion is hunting in the field called Ode, which signifies a wild and untamed territory, but is also a name given to the hunter as someone who can dominate this territory; hence the first chieftain of Ode was <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i>, who is both the woods and their patriarch. Divination by reading entrails was born in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. The fisherman<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s net also belongs here, as do all traps set to catch prey.</p>
<p class="indent">Rabbits, which represent the restlessness inherent in <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>nd<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>, are born in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. Snakes are also given their poison here, except for the boa constrictor, which represents the presence of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span>, and invites tranquillity and patience in contrast to the raging attack of vipers. This constellation of powers counsels the need to measure strength, and the importance of tempering one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s internal fire. Internal fire cultivated in a calculated and serene way can be harvested as understanding, but fire acted upon without contemplation leads to attack and eventually to war. One of the medicines used to help cultivate this fire is <i><span class="small">&#7885;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#7865;</span>d<span class="small">&#250;</span>d<span class="small">&#250;</span></i>, accompanied by other magical soaps known as <i><span class="small">&#7885;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#7865;</span><span class="small">&#232;</span>r<span class="small">&#242;</span></i>. These are made from the ashes of plantain, cocoa and other plants, which have a soothing effect in themselves, are used to carry medicine and magic, prepared and turned into powders that are then fused with the <i><span class="small">&#7885;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#7865;</span>d<span class="small">&#250;</span>d<span class="small">&#250;</span></i>. With the aid of calmative medicines, the inherent fire of the warrior and hunter is turned into a diplomatic force.</p>
<p class="indent">Fire is important in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. In<span class="small">&#225;</span> (fire) was the child of <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n. <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>nd<span class="small">&#225;</span> tells us that when In<span class="small">&#225;</span> was born, he was destined for fame, renown, friendship and power. In<span class="small">&#225;</span> however only made a part of his prescribed sacrifice, and asked for renown and fame. He was at first quite happy with his renown as a destroyer, and enjoyed his fame and took as much advantage of it as he could. But as time passed, he realized that everyone feared him and no one dared to come close to him. He found himself lonely and angry and finally decided to make the remainder of the sacrifice, but his fame as a dangerous person still stuck with him.</p>
<p class="indent">The lesson extracted from the story of In<span class="small">&#225;</span> indicates that in order to balance the energies of this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> it is important to give attention to <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> and to take the necessary time to consider our actions. Acting in haste is always a recipe for disaster, or at least for unwanted consequences to manifest.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_241"></a>A proverb in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> says: <span class="small">&#8216;</span>The stone you throw at a palm will return and hit you.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> We should not allow the recklessness of youth to disgrace our old age. The proverb speaks of the nature of the one we seek to harm; an upright person will repel mischief and aggression and return it on the wicked one. <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>nd<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> advises one to be the erect palm and not the thrower of stones.

<p class="indent">Such descriptions and praises go hand in hand with songs and prayers acclaiming his excellence as a hunter and his skill and wisdom. We also find songs to <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n which are impressively sexual in character, praising his huge and long member, as well as his equally impressive capacity for producing semen. These songs naturally emphasize the concept of virility conjoined with blood and fire.

<p class="indent">The tension between rodents and snakes is a familiar theme. If<span class="small">&#225;</span> advises us to be careful over who we are helping, because lack of appreciation will make good deeds tiresome to perform. The stories which expand upon this verse tell that eventually Rat was eaten by Cobra. <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>nd<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> is rich in stories speaking of ratlike and snakelike persons, and advises us to be careful with people because both offence and forgiveness are born in <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>nd<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>.</p>
<p class="indent">The shadow side of victory is that it inspires hubris, excessive confidence in one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s abilities, as demonstrated in the story that tells of how <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n lost the <i>igb<span class="small">&#225;</span> <span class="small">&#237;</span>w<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> (the calabash of character) to <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>. The story relates a challenge given to several <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#7865;</span></i>: the first who managed to reach Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span> on a given day would be gifted with the <i>igb<span class="small">&#225;</span> <span class="small">&#237;</span>w<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>, the secret of creation. <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n was one of the many <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> preparing for the contest. When the day came, he was the first to wake up and readied himself to go to Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span> to claim the <i>igb<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>. As he was preparing, he remembered he had previously set that day aside for an elephant hunt, and so he decided to send a slave in his place. The slave was called <span class="small">&#204;</span>d<span class="small">&#225;</span> and was a very good runner. <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n gave him a rooster, corn beer, kola nuts and cowry shells, and told him to hurry off to Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span> and present these gifts from him. <a id="page_243"></a><span class="small">&#204;</span>d<span class="small">&#225;</span> started to run, but after some time he decided to take a break at the foot of the <span class="small">&#204;</span>sin tree. The fruit appealed to him and he started to eat <span class="small">&#8211;</span> and he ate and ate, and the more he ate the more hungry he grew. He stayed there all day and only when evening came did he realize that his mission was a failure. He jumped down from the tree and ran off as fast as he could to Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span>, but when he arrived it was far too late and the <i>igb<span class="small">&#225;</span> <span class="small">&#237;</span>w<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> had been given to <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>, the first to approach Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span> that morning. At first <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n blamed his slave for the loss of the calabash, but when the slave pointed out that of all the 400 <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> that took part in the challenge <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n was the only one who sent a slave in his place, <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n realized that he had brought this upon himself and he accepted his loss. <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>nd<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> speaks of worldly ambition and how success can also invite recklessness and self-serving attitudes. <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>nd<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> is certainly victory and strength, demonstrating its glorious prominence, as much as the shades of restless passion it invites into our lives.</p>
