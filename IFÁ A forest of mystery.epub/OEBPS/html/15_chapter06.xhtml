<p class="noindent"><a id="page_129"></a>When <i><span class="small">&#200;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span> Ogb<span class="small">&#232;</span></i> speaks of the need for patience, tranquility and walking gently in the world, it says that this should be done because of our eventual passing. In the <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> following <i><span class="small">&#200;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span> Ogb<span class="small">&#232;</span></i>, the birth of light, we find darkness and annihilation. The human journey is here revealed to have an end.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>y<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>k<span class="small">&#250;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j&igrave;</i> manifests the marketplace as a symbol of life in Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span>. The marketplace is the site of fortune and misfortune, giving the good deal to the bad man and short changes the honest seeker. Chance and opportunity arise as a consequence of light being caught in matter and taking on a myriad of forms.

But it also speaks of how people will succumb to the temptation of greed. The seed of corruption is found here. This <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> speaks about materialism and avarice; it speaks about the meeting of friend and foe. In the verse cited, we should take notice of the word <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>gb<span class="small">&#7865;</span></i>, which denotes the community we belong to, whether in heaven or on earth. It is an admonition to recognize our shared humanity.</p>
<p class="indent">The marketplace is the field of Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span>, the earth, which is why the <i><span class="small">&#7885;</span>p<span class="small">&#7885;</span>n</i> If<span class="small">&#225;</span>, the divination board, is also born in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. The <i><span class="small">&#7885;</span>p<span class="small">&#7885;</span>n</i> If<span class="small">&#225;</span> is a symbolic representation of earth and manifestation, the full circle of the human journey. It is upon the <i><span class="small">&#7885;</span>p<span class="small">&#7885;</span>n</i> If<span class="small">&#225;</span> that the <i>awo</i> reveals the patterns of creation as they unfold.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#200;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span> Ogb<span class="small">&#232;</span></i> taught that the calabash of consciousness was dropped when it was brought from <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run to Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span>, and that the wisdom it contained was dispersed, but <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>y<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>k<span class="small">&#250;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> reveals that much of this wisdom was gathered by <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>nil<span class="small">&#233;</span>, the spirit of earth, with the help of <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>d<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span>. That which had been gathered was composed into <i>Igb<span class="small">&#225;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, the calabash of creation as the spirit of earth.</p>
<p class="indent">As she had been able to gather the wisdom that fell to earth, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>nil<span class="small">&#233;</span> was declared the <span class="small">&#8216;</span>owner of the womb of earth.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> Her ability to gather wisdom continued as the world moved on and replicated the 256 patterns of cosmic wisdom <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>nil<span class="small">&#233;</span> had secured. Because of this, it is necessary for a <i>babal<span class="small">&#225;</span>wo</i> to receive this spirit vessel, the <i>igb<span class="small">&#225;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>; to do so is to be given the power of the womb, a power that <a id="page_130"></a>woman holds naturally in her capacity of gestating the greatest mystery of all, life. The womb of woman is the manifestation of the cosmic womb of possibility, replicated in the womb of creation, which is understood to be the nature of Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span> as mediated by <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>nil<span class="small">&#233;</span>. This teaching is of the concealment of light, the secret gestation of life from ovum to birth. When light meets matter, a third element arises which is always a transformative power. This power is given to <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> in one form or another. I believe this is due to one of the more mystical interpretations of his name; that he is a ray or flash of light that generates a sphere, temporal order, or confinement.</p>
<p class="indent">The class of spirits known as <i>ajog<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i> (spirits of obstruction), <i>ik<span class="small">&#250;</span></i> (death), and <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>d<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span>, represented by the volcanic laterite stone known as <i>y<span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#237;</span></i>, are born in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>d<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span></i> means <span class="small">&#8216;</span>to disperse<span class="small">&#8217;</span> and what he disperses here is chance, luck and opportunity. The potential for fire was born with this stone, and through this, movement and transformation became possible.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>y<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>k<span class="small">&#250;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> explains the causes of human misery and why death is a natural phenomenon on the human journey. It represents the unknown, the mysteries of night, the accumulation of wealth and the end of any cycle. It is the power that seals the calabash of wisdom and existence. The Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span> idea of magic is lodged in something that happens in seemingly unnatural ways, or that interupts a natural course of action. This power of transformation is attributed to the interference of stars, either manipulated by magic, or as a consequence of grace, in which case it is termed a miracle. These secrets go far and run deep, but in the context of <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>y<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>k<span class="small">&#250;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> they refer to the unstable nature of the human being. Transformation is an integral part of humans, replicated and preserved in the concealment of night as a power which it is possible to manipulate. Nearly everything in creation is subject to manipulation and alteration, but one force lies outside their reach: death.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Ik<span class="small">&#250;</span></i>, the power that ends the human cycle, was born in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. An oft quoted Yorub<span class="small">&#225;</span> proverb tells us that this world is just a journey, whilst <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run is our home. So <i>ik<span class="small">&#250;</span></i> is the power that brings us back home. It is easy enough to accept this realization intellectually, but our feeling is often quite different when actually confronted with death. We fear death and we fear the darkness, just as we fear adversity and depression. Darkness is born in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>y<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>k<span class="small">&#250;</span></i> means that we pay reverence to the mother of the spirit of death. This reverence signals an acceptance of cycles, and the knowledge that every end is also a new beginning.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_131"></a>By daring the darkness, daring yourself to enter a new cycle, you can witness the closure of negative cycles, a death to the old in the spirit of change. <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>y<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>k&uacute;</i> is the space of contemplation and promise. She is the wisdom of the pole, the point that stretches out in the landscape and makes divination possible. Mankind approaches her with fear, not because of what she is, but because of what we are. We are shifting and unstable, an unruly creation mediating between stormy passions and calm reason, often identifying ourselves with the flux of the passions. The key is to seek a balance between <i><span class="small">&#7885;</span>k<span class="small">&#224;</span>n</i> (heart) and <i>or&iacute;</i> (consciousness) in which they are brought into dialogue. If we accomplish this we will be making divine hermeneutics, as one verse tells:</p>

<p class="indent">The verse speaks of the silence of contemplation, the need for reflection in order to allow our self to become known to us. This brings a recognition of who we truly are through the death of false ideas and ideals. It comes with an admonition to conduct ourselves with gentleness, in other words, to be true to ourselves. It always has the effect of bestowing kindness upon our surroundings, so that our children can bless our memory and feel pride when they remember our legacy.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_132"></a>This <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> is the root cause of melancholy, a condition referred to by the multiple meanings given to the word <i>d<span class="small">&#250;</span>d<span class="small">&#250;</span></i> (dark/black). This is the colour of mystery and concealment. Not knowing who we are or where we are going invites <span class="small">&#8216;</span>blackness<span class="small">&#8217;</span> into our life. The challenge lies in not falling in love with one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s depression or dark moods, but in using this condition to reach our potential. Dark moods lead us towards the edges of our being, a condition where we feel alive because death is so close. This is the fire of protection rising within: it tells us that we are mud and clay in a process of metamorphosis. This is the spirit of the mother of death, the wise compass that directs our way. We should show caution, and not mistake the spirit of death for death itself. Death, <i>ik<span class="small">&#250;</span></i>, is a dread power, the end of the human condition, the grim reaper himself.</p>
<p class="indent">The role of Ik<span class="small">&#250;</span> is important, being concerned with balance. One of the many versions of this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> imparts that Ik<span class="small">&#250;</span> was most happy with the creation of humans, because he found them to be delicious and made them his favourite food. But he was insatiable and always lacked satisfaction or pleasure. The people of earth went to <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> to find a solution to the wild ways of Ik<span class="small">&#250;</span>, and he advised them to prepare a meal with one chicken, camwood, yam, red cloth and pebbles. The chicken had to be tied to a post alive and the pebble rich meal should be placed in front of it. Ik<span class="small">&#250;</span> came and saw the food and tried to eat it, but the hard pebbles made it impossible for him to consume his meal. Discouraged, he went on and found the chicken clucking. The sound frightened him. The frightening sound and the unusual food led him to believe that the humans had gained possession of magical powers, and so he took his leave from Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span>. The world entered a time in which no one got sick, no one died, and chaos and confusion arose. Seeing that the natural balance was upset, the elders of the city went to <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> and presented the problem to him. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> made offerings to <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> with kola nuts, bitter kola nuts and a bottle of gin. <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> came and told him that he would take care of the imbalance, but <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> needed to stay indoors for the next 24 hours and prepare some good food for him. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> did as instructed. The next night, <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> called Ik<span class="small">&#250;</span> to dine with him. Ik<span class="small">&#250;</span> came and complained to <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> that he had been tricked by <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>, and had come to enjoy some time with <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> before going out to kill all the votaries of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>. When Ik<span class="small">&#250;</span> had eaten his fill, he complimented <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> on his cooking, and told him that it was now time for him to kill off the If<span class="small">&#225;</span> priests. <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> replied that the meal had been prepared for them both by <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>, to ensure that people would not die in their youth. Ik<span class="small">&#250;</span> <a id="page_133"></a>became annoyed, but respectfully agreed to the terms of the offering, and swore to not devour <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> and his followers. Death returned to the world, but now he would only take those in ripe old age.</p>
<p class="indent">Although Ik<span class="small">&#250;</span> returned to heaven after the initial offering, he sent his emissaries to the world to catch food for him. These were his wife, Sickness, and his children, Loss, Despair, Poverty and Turmoil; the spirits we know as <i>ajog<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i>. These are forces that impede good fortune, and we often consider them to be evil. If<span class="small">&#225;</span> states that we attract these powers of obstruction through our choices, our attitudes and general carelessness. It is here that the concept of taboo enters. The concept of taboo is understood to be something we renounce, set aside or treat as something <span class="small">&#8216;</span>other<span class="small">&#8217;</span> in order to attract good fortune. Every taboo given <span class="small">&#8211;</span> whether concerning food, colours, attitudes or actions <span class="small">&#8211;</span> is to avoid attracting <i>ajog<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i> into your life. Taboo serves as a conductor of good fortune if it is respected, something that will bring rewards as we embark on our human journey in this marketplace we know as the world. This is a place where good and bad trade can be carried out, where thieves and truth mingle. The journey itself signifies a progress from one place to another; it is in the spaces inbetween that the unexpected can occur. If<span class="small">&#225;</span> teaches that a bed of tranquility and peace awaits those who take <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>w<span class="small">&#224;</span> rere</i> (good character) as their compass. Hence the Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span> proverb <span class="small">&#8216;</span>If you don<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t know what road to take, develop good character.<span class="small">&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="indent">If<span class="small">&#225;</span> teaches that creation was caused by the dream of light which was made visible in <i><span class="small">&#200;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span> Ogb<span class="small">&#232;</span></i>. With the birth of light, earth and darkness also entered the design; <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>y<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>k<span class="small">&#250;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> forms its support and contrast.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>y<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>k<span class="small">&#250;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> speaks of how <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> descended upon a golden chain, the same as that which is used to tie together the <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>p<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>l<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i> seeds for divination, and landed on top of a palm tree. The palm served as his guide as he travelled around Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span>land seeking his fortune. This took some time, as he was met with constant ingratitude and greed, though finally he was made king of the city of Oketase. The palm tree was rewarded with great prestige because of the help it had given him. The palm tree, <i><span class="small">&#7885;</span>p<span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> (<i>Elaeis guineensis</i>), gives <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>p<span class="small">&#7885;</span></i> (palm oil), while its close and royal relative, the king palm (<i>Elaeis guinensis idolatrica</i>) gives the sacred palm nuts, <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>k<span class="small">&#237;</span>n</i>, which are the most dignified tool used in If<span class="small">&#225;</span> divination. The ability of <i><span class="small">&#7885;</span>p<span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> to direct one through challenges towards destiny and fortune became the symbol of knowledge of the earth. Thus, the <i><span class="small">&#7885;</span>p<span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> or its loyal friend the <i>p<span class="small">&#232;</span>r<span class="small">&#232;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i> (<i>Dracaena arborea</i>), should be planted in any place where If<span class="small">&#225;</span> is practiced.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_134"></a>In this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> we find the <i>ok<span class="small">&#249;</span>n</i> beads. These beads were originally of glass and ceramics and used to beautify kings and nobility. Today <i>ok<span class="small">&#249;</span>n</i> are synonymous with beads in general and are used as tokens of kingship or queenship in relation to <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i> and If<span class="small">&#225;</span> cults. They preserve the idea of authority, conquest and ascent. In a profane context, these concepts turn into those of social class, and in this we find an important lesson of this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. No ascent is about being better than anyone else, it is always about realizing one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s own destiny. One should be humble before fate.</p>
<p class="indent">Strictly speaking, <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>y<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>k<span class="small">&#250;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> is the twilight, from the word <i><span class="small">&#x025A;</span>y<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i>, which is used of the two magical junctures when there is neither day nor night, representing liminal times which are extremely benevolent for petitions and prayers. The twilight is the gateway for possibilities, where polarities blend into one another. The twilight is understood as a wondrous and beautiful contrast, because it was the foster parent of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">A story relates how <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> was adopted by <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>y<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>k<span class="small">&#250;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s parents, the triple crossroad and the dumpster. His foster parents were rich and obese, always searching for food, delight and things of beauty. His foster father was gentle, but deep down greedy, while his foster mother took an obsessive delight in the witches<span class="small">&#8217;</span> mysteries. They were good people, but had wholly material and selfish inclinations. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> found them lacking in character because they did not seek to develop good character, which showed itself in their disregard for moderation. Hence it is because of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s foster parents, the parents of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>y<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>k<span class="small">&#250;</span>, that the seed of greed and selfishness was planted in the market of the world. Because of this, If<span class="small">&#225;</span> insists upon the importance of moderation, of nourishing body, soul and spirit. Moderation is the key word here, as there is nothing wrong with the gluttony of the generous foster father, just as there is nothing wrong in the witchy interests of the foster mother. After all, it is in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> that <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> marries Oj<span class="small">&#225;</span> (prosperity) and Aje (wealth) a marriage that was the direct consequence of his generosity, hospitality and kindness to his community.</p>
<p class="indent">Illusion was born in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, symbolized by the spider that connects the points of creation into a web of deadly beauty in which we can all be caught. The spider is magic incarnate. She represents the essence of possibilities in the world. She spins the web that covers the womb of mystery. The spider<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s silk is of the nature of the Moon, and silk is the ladder to the other side, whilst cotton is what embalms humanity.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_137"></a>All trees and plants that fold their leaves at the onset of night belong to this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. The tree known as <i>ay<span class="small">&#249;</span>nr<span class="small">&#233;</span></i> is chief amongst them. It is said to give protection against death because <i>ik<span class="small">&#250;</span></i> found itself defeated in front of it. This tree has more than 150 relatives, and one of these which represents the full force of <i>ay<span class="small">&#249;</span>nr<span class="small">&#233;</span></i> is <i>Mimosa pudica</i>. Its leaves will retract and coil up when touched, demonstrating a reclusive energy that appears magical and dramatic. Most of its relatives react in this way to night and the moon, but this one does so in response to touch. Papyrus has the same virtue, but shares an a<span class="small">&#64259;</span>nity with the palm tree in its upright stature. This family includes a wide range of Albizia and Acacia species, some of which are rich in DMT.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>y<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>k<span class="small">&#250;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> speaks of how the <i>ay<span class="small">&#249;</span>nr<span class="small">&#233;</span></i> stood up against Ik<span class="small">&#250;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s lust for human flesh and how he tried to subdue it repeatedly without success. This tree is complex in its virtues. It is good to plant it on your property and dress it in red cloth to ward off death, but the use of its leaves and flowers can equally provoke the presence of <i>ik<span class="small">&#250;</span></i>.</p>
<p class="indent">Several black berried plants, such as various solanums and the eggplant, are born in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. These are plants that give the final solace; death is found in these who herald the end with their beauty. The essence of the solanum, to give solace, is related to men and woman with a mission of bringing an end to suffering. It is an <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> that inspires misguided prophets. The biblical story of Jesus<span class="small">&#8217;</span> mission is found in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. It tells how Jewesun (the name of Jesus in <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run) came to earth on a mission to destroy the powers that inhibited human happiness, in particular he wanted to take down <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>. He made divination in <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run before coming to earth, and was advised to make <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span></i> to <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> to ensure that his mission would be accomplished, but he refused. Jewesun saw no point in making <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span></i> when he was going to earth with such a just cause, and certainly he would never make <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span></i> to <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>. Jesus was given a final chance to make <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span></i> to <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> when the King of the World (the devil in the Bible) showed him all the kingdoms of the world, and declared that he would make them his if Jewesun made the prescribed <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span></i>. This he refused to do, and consequently brought about the premature end of his human cycle. Curiously, given the importance of the fish as a Christian symbol, it is in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> that the fish was born and given as food for humankind.</p>
<p class="indent">This <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> carries the energy of dispersion, and because of this, harmonious gathering is crucial:</p>

<p class="indent">We should come together as in the harmony of many voices bringing forth a song. We should call upon the benevolent gathering of human forces so that we can support each other in our pursuit of fulfilment and happiness. In the end, the one who walks alone, really does walk alone.</p>
<p class="indent">In this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> the importance of <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>w<span class="small">&#224;</span></i> <i>pele</i> is signalled as clearly as it can ever be. <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>w<span class="small">&#224;</span></i> <i>pele</i> means good character, but particularly the good character that arises because we pay reverence to Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span>. When we pay reverence to the earth, we also reverence our ancestors; those she brought to her bosom by the intervention of <i>ik<span class="small">&#250;</span></i>, and those she took in mysterious ways. <i>Ik<span class="small">&#250;</span></i> makes reincarnation possible. We repeat our cycles, and our character/soul constantly experiences the joy of the human journey, and undergoes growth and illumination. <i>Ik<span class="small">&#250;</span></i> is the one who takes us back home when we reach our destination.</p>
<p class="indent">This <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> represents the memory of who we are. Every <i>babal<span class="small">&#225;</span>wo</i> will tell you that it is important to remember your ancestry in order to have a notion of where you come from. Looking back, you will be able to see your own growth and to heal family curses. These are negative patterns which have evoked <i>ajog<span class="small">&#250;</span>ns</i> in the course of your family<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s history. In recognizing these patterns and making a declaration of change we are greeting the earth in reverence, and through this we generate a fire that infuses our ancestry with life. This <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> concerns the deeds we perform which bring honour to our lineage, and to ourselves as the living embodiment of our ancestry. If<span class="small">&#225;</span> refers to ancestors as <i>eg<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i>, a word that means <span class="small">&#8216;</span>bones.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> These bones preserve the memory of the ancestors who, upon leaving them behind, once more become <i>ar<span class="small">&#225;</span> <span class="small">&#x025A;</span>run</i>, meaning denizens of heaven; <a id="page_139"></a>the word <i>ara</i> also signifies <span class="small">&#8216;</span>embodiment.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> This <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> further expands on the concept of <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i>. An <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i> is one who has mastered the human experience, guided by immortal and natural forces, and becomes deified; becoming an aspect of the natural principle which they lived out in their human journey. In doing so, each of the 256 <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span>s</i> gains marrow and structure and becomes more salient in the world as we expand the consciousness of our ancestry.</p>
<p class="indent">Ancestor reverence is born in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> because it brings riches, and darkness. In remembering your ancestors, you access the energetic circuit that makes you who you are. You can count your blessings and rectify dysfunction. The memory of ancestry is used in Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span> society as a compass for the newly born; in ancestry we find guidance. We need to understand that an ancestor who made a bad journey can be a good, albeit often di<span class="small">&#64259;</span>cult, advisor on our own journey. At core, we are our own ancestors, we are all connected with one another through the presence of <i>eg<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i>. Blood and spirit are equally important, which the notion of the extended family demonstrates. To be bound to a family in spirit and recognition is as important for the Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span> as to be bound by blood. This is evident in all forms of <i>ib<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>, prayers of gratitude, which honour one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s ancestry. We find here names of blood relatives and spiritual relatives recited side by side. This concept was always kept alive in African societies and made possible the succession of legacy after the dispersion caused by the transatlantic slave trade. It is a concept that should serve as medicine for those who are adopted or otherwise alienated from their ancestry. We are all children of the forces that inhabit Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span>, and kin can be recognized both in blood and in spirit, the attraction between souls.</p>
<p class="indent">Life is a mysterious condition. So many of us struggle to find self and identity in a world of demands and flux where we constantly search for the quiet place, the oasis of comfort in which we can centre ourselves. It is in soliloquy that we speak with source and our attendant daimons and spirits. Such a communion with self is a meeting with death, who makes us question not only who we are, but also what legacy we pass on. To know yourself in the embrace of death is to gain a vision of legacy, a flash of what you leave behind. Selfhood is an axis around which the world dances. Yet that axis, that starry pillar, is the marrow of this fluctuating self which takes on masks and forms out of conformity and necessity, whilst that core, the substance, shines through. Self is unique to self and fate reveals itself to those who are true to themselves. True selfhood is the <a id="page_140"></a>path and gate towards fulfilment and bliss. Whenever we pretend to be what we are not, or allow ourselves to be driven to achieve goals that are not truly ours, we see only despair and hopelessness.</p>
<p class="indent">Death is our constant companion as we walk the paths of life. Death is our legacy, the mirror that shines with beauty or disgrace as we end our journey. It is always possible to conduct our self in this world with gentleness. It is our capacity for gentleness that will inscribe our legacy in ink of wormwood or roseblood.</p>
<p class="indent">Living our lives in mindfulness of our legacy will constantly temper our tendencies towards vice and anger. Though we all must meet death, it is death that makes us immortal, that brings forgetfulness and testaments of shame. It is never enough to merely have good intentions, these pave the road to Hell. Those who walk the path of self-deception grow strong in anger, resentment and pride. Those who have ventured down the path of lies and deception will cry out that they don<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t care about what they leave behind: they say this because they, and their foul legacy, are already dead. <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>y<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>k<span class="small">&#250;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> is the mystery of death and decay, it holds the secrets that promise renewal through the flux and intervention of one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s ancestry.</p>
