<p class="noindent"><a id="page_185"></a><i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>w<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>nr<span class="small">&#237;</span>n m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j</i><span class="small">&#236;</span> is one of the most important and enigmatic energies amongst the pairs of <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. Its importance is derived from it being the repository of energy from which <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>d<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> takes his <i><span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#7865;</span></i>. <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>d<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> is the transformative power of <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> that shapes miracles and tragedy, and the matter he uses for shaping these great magical transformations is found in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. In other words, every manifestation and form of <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> will always have something to do with <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>w<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>nr<span class="small">&#237;</span>n</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">It is one of the most enigmatic <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span>s</i> because of its potency for cataclysmic change, and is the power that promotes deep equality as the principle that sustains creation itself. While <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>ros<span class="small">&#249;</span>n</i> denotes the good and blessed condition in which we start our journey on earth, <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>w<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>nr<span class="small">&#237;</span>n</i> manifests hardship, and the ability to endure in times of want. One<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s track towards good fortune is taken with determined and measured steps.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>w<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>nr<span class="small">&#237;</span>n</i> is represented by two triangles standing on top of each other, each with three points marked on their three sides. These represent the magnetic poles of Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span>, each pole bearing an imprint of the fiery and magnetic source of earth itself. The triangle marked with three points at each corner is a reference to the mysteries wielded and secured by the <span class="small">&#7884;</span>gb<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>ni society. While <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>ros<span class="small">&#249;</span>n</i> brings the forces that ensure stability to Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span>, <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>w<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>nr<span class="small">&#237;</span>n</i> brings the subtle magnetic forces that uphold this stability or annihilate it.</p>
<p class="indent">The power of this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> is found at the nape of the neck, which is where the powers of <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> reside. The reference to the nape of the neck announces the importance of the cerebellum, which is also known as the primitive or reptilian brain. The cerebellum is responsible for motor control, coordination and precision as well as basic reflexes. When an organism is confronted with something that threatens it the cerebellum is activated. The cerebellum is intertwined with the central nervous system, the arbor vitae, a name referring to the evergreen tree of life in the garden of Eden which is also given to other evergreens, especially ferns and <i>Thuja</i> species in general. On a biological and metaphysical level, these parts of the brain, together with the pineal gland, enable us to experience a world outside ourselves, whether visible or invisible. The magnetic and electric current in the brain mimics the relationship between the core of the earth and the magnetic poles, and this explains why If<span class="small">&#225;</span> defines this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> as <span class="small">&#8216;</span>the owner of cosmic cataclysm.<span class="small">&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>w<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>nr<span class="small">&#237;</span>n</i> is clearly an energy that speaks of hardship, of the kind of hardship that sustains creation and good fortune. It is an energy that possesses immense <a id="page_186"></a>knowledge and wisdom of the fundamental structures of creation, and in particular the secrets that cause Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span> to possess a regenerative stability that shows itself in death, decay and the promise of new births.</p>
<p class="indent">The story of Mof<span class="small">&#x0276;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span>n<span class="small">&#237;</span> is pertinent to this energy. He was a strong man, intelligent and resourceful, but nothing worked out for him in spite of all his skills. Nonetheless, he worked on and kept faith until his mother died. Her death brought him many responsibilities, and he had no resources available with which to fulfil them. He saw no way out of this situation except to borrow money from a local pawnbroker. Before going to him, Mof<span class="small">&#x0276;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span>n<span class="small">&#237;</span> went to his Awo and asked for advice. His <i>awo</i> told him to give a rooster to <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>d<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> and a pigeon to his <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i>. The <i>awo</i> also advised him to get some chickens and make a coop. When Mof<span class="small">&#x0276;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span>n<span class="small">&#237;</span> borrowed the money, the pawnbroker demanded that he should stay on his farm and pay off the debt with work, which he agreed to do. Mof<span class="small">&#x0276;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span>n<span class="small">&#237;</span> was a hard worker, and made the farm beautiful and lucrative. In the meantime, his chickens started to lay eggs. From the eggs came more chickens and even more eggs. His chicken coop became abundant, and promised to bring in enough money for Mof<span class="small">&#x0276;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span>n<span class="small">&#237;</span> to buy his freedom. But the pawnbroker had no interest in loosing such a good worker and so one night he accidently fell upon the fence that secured the chickens and killed them all. When Mof<span class="small">&#x0276;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span>n<span class="small">&#237;</span> came to take care of his chickens the following day, he saw that they were all dead, and he broke down in tears. It was then that <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>d<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> came to him, and told him that he should roast all the chickens and store them. Mof<span class="small">&#x0276;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span>n<span class="small">&#237;</span> did as <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> recommended and stored them in a safe place. That same day there was turbulence at the royal palace because the successor to the throne had fallen gravely ill. The diviners said that the remedy lay in finding 10 chickens from the same mother, that had been hatched on the same day and died on the same day. This was crucial for making the If<span class="small">&#225;</span> medicine that would save the life of the successor to the throne. <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>d<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> entered the assembly of diviners and told them where to find what they needed. He then went to Mof<span class="small">&#x0276;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span>n<span class="small">&#237;</span>, and told him that someone would come asking for his roasted chickens and that he should charge a great deal of money for them, assuring him that they would be willing and able to pay. Not long afterwards, the royal retinue appeared asking for chickens. Mof<span class="small">&#x0276;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span>n<span class="small">&#237;</span> told them that the only chickens he had were already roasted because they all had died on the same day. The royal convoy told him that this was exactly what they were searching for and asked him the price for ten of them. He gave the price <a id="page_187"></a><span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> had told him to give, which they gladly paid. The pawnbroker had watched all that occurred from a hiding place. When he saw that Mof<span class="small">&#x0276;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span>n<span class="small">&#237;</span> had gained far, far more money than he owed in debt, he broke down in tears, knowing that he would lose his magnificent worker. Not only did he lose his magnificent worker, but, as he had been obsessed with Mof<span class="small">&#x0276;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span>n<span class="small">&#237;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s good fortune all this time, he lost his own. He was forced to work for Mof<span class="small">&#x0276;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span>n<span class="small">&#237;</span>, who from this day onward experienced only prosperity, wealth and increase.</p>
<p class="indent">In this story, If<span class="small">&#225;</span> discusses the importance of need, which is understood to be a fire that moves us to do what needs to be done. In the tale of Mof<span class="small">&#x0276;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span>n<span class="small">&#237;</span>, we see the spirit of endurance fused with faith. Instead of sinking into failure, becoming depressed and falling in love with his misery, he didn<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t give up.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">In this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, we meet the <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>r<span class="small">&#243;</span>k<span class="small">&#242;</span></i> tree again. A man<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s two wives had a quarrel over the cause of the younger wife<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s child falling ill. A divination was performed, and it turned out that the senior wife had complained about the junior wife to some <a id="page_188"></a>other women she had met in the market under the <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>r<span class="small">&#243;</span>k<span class="small">&#242;</span></i> tree. It so happened that a great gathering of witches was held in the crown of the tree that night, and they heard the complaints and lamentations of the senior wife and decided to give the younger wife<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s child a critical illness. She was advised to make <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span></i> with a rabbit to the witches dwelling in the <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>r<span class="small">&#243;</span>k<span class="small">&#242;</span></i>, and the child recovered because of the senior wife<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s efforts. The message here is that we need to be careful of what we wish for and that we should exercise caution over the kind of words we allow mind and heart to give shape to. Negative words call upon negative spirits by means of their shared element of air, just as good words call upon spirits of benevolence. In Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span> the word for a sentence is <i><span class="small">&#x025A;</span>r<span class="small">&#x025A;</span></i>. We find here a play on words so typical of the language, and even more typical of how words and meanings are expressed in paradoxes and contrasts in If<span class="small">&#225;</span>, as there exists a cult which is intimately related to this idea of the word as a formulation of will, desire and character, namely the cult of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#x025A;</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">The cult of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#x025A;</span> is a nocturnal cult that walks with machete and bird wings on the bones of Eg<span class="small">&#250;</span>ng<span class="small">&#250;</span>n and holds the power and authority of purifying cities, homes and districts of negative energies and presences. Not only this, but <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#x025A;</span> represents the very soul of Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span> justice and the members of this cult execute judgments made by the <span class="small">&#7884;</span>gb<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>ni society. They play an important part in funeral rites, and possess the secrets that rejuvenate corpses for a short time after death. They are an extension of the Eg<span class="small">&#250;</span>ng<span class="small">&#250;</span>n society, and hold the bullroarer as their sacred symbol, which gives them access to the various types of wind that brings life to bones. One particular set of winds holds tremendous importance: they are said to be the winds that make one disappear into <i>igb<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, where one is taught directly by <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#7865;</span></i>. This secret is so profound that it has caused <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#x025A;</span> to be associated with the lava at the centre of the earth, through typifying a similar hot wind that we find in the presence of lava. On subtle levels this is true, but the owner of lava is <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>d<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span>, who manifests in the laterite rock, the volcanic product turned into stone. It is the presence of these mysterious, subtle and destructive forces that causes this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> to be that which <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> models his <i><span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> upon, and which constitutes change and transformation. As such, we can say that it is here that secrecy has its root, along with the secret societies that guard the mysteries of nature.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> is often understood to be a trickster spirit, but this is a simplification of his role: he is the divine linguist who was given the power of making our <a id="page_189"></a>prayers, sacrifices and supplications acceptable. He possesses the necessary ambiguity of a power that challenges us to make choices in his capacity of being the very nature of transformation. <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> is the principle that makes choice possible, rather than a trickster spirit. There is always a code of honour in our dealings with <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>, a call to nobility in the fundamental sense of the word. By this I mean that a noble stance is one of excellence and dignity, an attitude towards life that enables us to accept and use the changes in the world stoically.</p>
<p class="indent">There are many stories of how <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> came into the world, and one of them tells of his being the child of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span>un and <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>, meaning that he was the product of wisdom fertilizing the potency for sweetness on earth. But the womb of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span>un also represents the period of mysterious transformation which any foetus goes through during gestation. The tale of <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> being gestated by the power of sweetness and honey would indicate that all trials and challenges we are confronted with in life will ultimately have the wisdom of sweetness as their goal. This fusion of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span>un and <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> is also the particular combination of powers that constitutes the concept of <i><span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#7865;</span></i>.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>w<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>nr<span class="small">&#237;</span>n</i> is not the <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> which gave birth to <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>, as some claim; that was <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>, the subject of our concluding chapter. In <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>w<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>nr<span class="small">&#237;</span>n</i>, we find that <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s expressions and his praise names, El<span class="small">&#x0276;</span>gb<span class="small">&#225;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span> or Al<span class="small">&#224;</span>gb<span class="small">&#225;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span>, are related to the type of power he draws from this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, namely as the one who uses the scent and heat of what is as yet unformed (<i>al<span class="small">&#224;</span></i>) in the essence of fire to shape life. This leads us to the root of a warrior ethos, as is told in one of the combinations of <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>w<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>nr<span class="small">&#237;</span>n</i>, <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>w<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>nr<span class="small">&#237;</span>n-<span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>:</p>

<p class="indent">This stanza carries a deeper message than standing fast, because the combination of forces we find here speak of being certain of who you are as you venture into the unknown, and of accepting everything as a challenge. Being fully aware of who we are requires us to use our skills and abilities to our benefit and to our opponent<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s detriment. The stanza conceives of <span class="small">&#8216;</span>the fight<span class="small">&#8217;</span> in a wider context. It is about the fight for self acknowledgement, and the fight against what threatens who you are. If we are true to ourselves, we will reap glory, but the way to make this discovery is to enter onto the battlefield, not only to answer the challenge of the enemies waiting there, but also the enemy within.</p>
<p class="indent">The ideal of the warrior is most poignantly represented by <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n himself, the blacksmith and forger of metals. Yet, in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> we meet a different kind of warrior, one refined by the rustic and fiery beating of <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n. Erinl<span class="small">&#232;</span> is an <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i> who takes part of his <i><span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> from this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. He is associated with the elephant, and is said to have been a very successful warrior, fisherman and herbalist. He is a renowned healer who works both the medicine of the forest and that of the waters. A certain finesse and facility in regard to nature is found in Erinl<span class="small">&#233;</span>, as it is in <span class="small">&#210;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>m<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#233;</span>, who also surfaces in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, turning his head and tail into a full circle. Like <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>, they both hold a particular attitude towards life that turns the hardness in this od<span class="small">&#249;</span> into sweetness. Erinl<span class="small">&#232;</span> represents a balance between water and earth, just as <span class="small">&#210;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>m<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#233;</span> holds night and day in balance. One must accept the cyclical nature of creation as one walks onwards, and extract the necessary blessings and lessons from steps already taken.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>w<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>nr<span class="small">&#237;</span>n</i> gives the lesson of being present in the moment, and receiving the moment in a state of calm anticipation. This is the spirit of the adventurer who does not linger in cities that bring ruin, but who has the ability to find rest when good possibilities in life open up, allowing wisdom to guide the way. Doing this, one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s very being will become a blessing not only to oneself, but also to others.</p>
<p class="image"><a id="page_191"></a><img src="docimages/f0191-01.jpg" height="100%" alt="Image"/><a id="page_192"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_193"></a>As the bridge between worlds, <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>d<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> represents the very vehicle of salvation, hence his association with crossroads. He is the one who brings the morning dew which serves as food for <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>nil<span class="small">&#233;</span>, and the air and fire that stir the world and influence our choices so that we can pursue our good fortune and grow wiser on our journey. He is the author of energetic currents, and, as the power that is present in the moment, he always oversees balance. An example of this is that good deeds receive financial compensation. <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> prevents us from getting something for nothing.</p>
<p class="indent">The vehicle for <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s power, the mouth, is found in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. It is born here, and said to be the father of all sacrifice. The mouth is the organ we use to utter our sentiments, thoughts and desires. It is the messenger of wishes, curses and blessings, shaping thoughts and emotions into words. It follows that our words carry power and we should at all times watch what we say. With words we can hurt or elevate our fellow travellers. With words we give promises and our character reveals itself. The mouth is the father of sacrifice, because our words are the product of what we have digested in our hearts and minds.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>w<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>nr<span class="small">&#237;</span>n</i> constantly brings the importance of other people to our attention. We will always find our fortune <span class="small">&#8211;</span> and misfortune <span class="small">&#8211;</span> amongst them. One story that highlights this concerns <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>gb<span class="small">&#236;</span>gb<span class="small">&#242;</span></i>, the hoopoe, which is a bird sacred to Erinl<span class="small">&#232;</span>, <span class="small">&#210;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>m<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#233;</span>, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span>un and <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>. <span class="small">&#210;</span>gb<span class="small">&#236;</span>gb<span class="small">&#242;</span> was the leader of all birds and enjoyed everyone<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s respect, but also someone<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s envy. It so happened that <span class="small">&#210;</span>w<span class="small">&#236;</span>w<span class="small">&#237;</span> (owl), a handsome, wealthy and debauched man, plotted to steal the wife of Hoopoe, his king. Even though he was constantly bedding beautiful women, he fixed his desire upon his king<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s wife and managed to seduce her. They moved in together and were immediately scorned by all the other birds. Whenever Owl left his house, there was always someone there ready to beat him, or throw rocks at him. He became more and more nervous, and started to go out only at night. All his charm was lost to his anxiety, and his lover left him to contemplate his fate. Owl became resentful and started to blame his diviners, his friends, and everyone else for his plight, until one night when he realised that he was the creator of his misfortune. He tried to change his ways, but was too proud to offer the necessary sacrifice, and hence he became associated with bad omens and wicked business transactions.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_194"></a>This <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> comes with the message to not <span class="small">&#8216;</span>wear another man<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s apron,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> a warning not to steal another man<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s possessions, and in particular not to steal his spouse. Owl lusted after what was not his, even though he already had more than enough, which caused him to become a harbinger of bad omens. This <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> also comes with the counsel of not being disappointed by people; rather, we should try to understand what is going on in the world and choose our confidantes wisely. We should be mindful of the importance of public opinion and how other people<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s words can have an effect on our lives, because we never know who will lend an ear to negative remarks and complaints.</p>
<p class="indent">This <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> also brings the powers that sustain harmonious relationships. It speaks of the idea of soulmates, those two people who enter into a benevolent and beautiful unity when they find one another, such that one will suffer without the other. This is illustrated by <i><span class="small">&#7885;</span>p<span class="small">&#7865;</span> <span class="small">&#232;</span>l<span class="small">&#249;</span>j<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, the wine palm, who wanted to marry the man she had loved from the first moment she laid eyes upon him. This beautiful man was the calabash tree (<i>Crescentia cujeta</i>). The wine palm went to her <i>awo</i> for a divination and was told to travel to the city of her beloved. At the same time the calabash tree went to his <i>awo</i> and asked for advice on exactly the same thing: he wanted to locate and marry the woman he had met in his younger days, as he had been in love with her ever since. His <i>awo</i> told him to go to the city of Palm Vine and so he went to her city to find her. Midway between their cities they met, and received all possible good fortune and everlasting love. This love is seen in how palm wine (<i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>mu</i>) needs the gourd (<i>ak<span class="small">&#232;</span>r<span class="small">&#232;</span>gb<span class="small">&#232;</span></i>) to hold it. This story also warns against people who try to separate the two, who are considered foolish and witless in trying to separate what is meant to be together forever.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#192;</span>gb<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>n</i> (coconut) was created as a promise of good fortune to a very wealthy couple who wanted children but who had experienced problems conceiving. It was the falling of the coconut that announced the happy news of fertility. The couple went to an <i>awo</i> to see what they could do about the issue and were told to perform sacrifice. One part of the sacrifice was <i><span class="small">&#x025A;</span>g<span class="small">&#224;</span></i> (chameleon), which they were advised to rub over the woman<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s pregnant belly for sixteen days in order to ensure the birth of a gifted and healthy child who would receive all good fortune. The pregnancy was an easy one, and she gave birth to a child who they called <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>g<span class="small">&#224;</span>nrara in honour of the chameleon who facilitated his birth.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>g<span class="small">&#224;</span>nrara was most unpleasant to look at, his health was fragile, and he only provoked disgust and resentment in people. As he grew up it only became <a id="page_195"></a>worse. He could not get work, nor make any friends. One day he decided to go to the babalawos and see what was going on. They cast opele for him and told him that he had forgotten to bring his promised good fortune from heaven with him. He made <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span></i> after <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span></i> but with no result. He went from <i>awo</i> to <i>awo</i> to find a solution, until one day he found a conclave of six <i>babal<span class="small">&#225;</span>wos</i> who he approached for a solution to his distress. They took out their <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>k<span class="small">&#237;</span>ns</i> and divined for him, and asked him about the circumstances of his birth and gestation. He told them what had occurred with his parents, and how no good fortune came his way despite his being rubbed with the chameleon for sixteen days. The conclave of <i>babal<span class="small">&#225;</span>wos</i> immediately realized what had gone wrong. They told him that he was a child of Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span> himself, because the chameleon is the power of God on earth. He was advised not to try so hard, but rather to go home and wish for good fortune to come to him. He was advised to draw up a list of priorities and make his wishes in a realistic fashion. And so he did. Upon returning home he planned his wishes and desires in order of need, the first being to be liked by people. Soon after, he started to experience the goodwill of people, and found good friends. Wish after wish was fulfilled as he stated them, and it didn<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t take long before he was surrounded by all the good fortune that he had been promised. The chameleon is important in this story, because he knows how to blend in with society and recognize red as red and black as black. He is not a turncoat; rather he is characterised by his capacity for discernment.</p>
<p class="indent">One stanza is interesting in regard to this ability of discernment, as it concerns the influence of <span class="small">&#8216;</span>the elders of the night.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>g<span class="small">&#224;</span>nrara goes to a wide variety of wise ones and he always receives good advice, but somehow he never manages to get the desired results. When he goes to the witches, or <span class="small">&#8216;</span>Elders of the Night,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> we read the following:</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">This verse pinpoints the problem; <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>g<span class="small">&#224;</span>nrara was not selective enough, and was not careful enough about who he associated with. As a child of <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>w<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>nr<span class="small">&#237;</span>n</i>, he had a direct link with these two birds associated with witchcraft, which carried a lesson that he needed to pay particular attention to. An admonition to take care is also given: <span class="small">&#8216;</span>lest two birds of <span class="small">&#7884;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#237;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span> come into contact with each other.<span class="small">&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="indent">Here we touch upon another deep mystery in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, namely how <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> (<span class="small">&#7884;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#237;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>) is the mediator and owner of the two forces in the world that generate movement, <i><span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> and <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>. The sum of these is <i><span class="small">&#242;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#242;</span></i>, the term denoting the presence of the sorcerous powers of night, but which also forms part of the mystery which an <i>awo</i> must understand in order to be effective in his divinations. The mystery of mysteries, generically called <i>awo</i>, is supported and understood through respect. It is about respecting one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s parents, elders, ancestors, friends and even one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s foes. In particular, one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s mother needs to be respected, which hints at the importance of the legacy one inherits through her side of the family, and further suggests the presence of very demanding and complicated mothers in one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s life, who must be seen as forces that help to mould our inner wisdom. There is a constant admonition to understand any challenge, to do whatever you can, and to take opportunities when they present themselves. But opportunities should not be taken greedily, but with care and understanding so that they may bring good fortune. It is in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> that the idea of quality is born. Quality is forged through dedication, attention and care. It follows that this is the sort of slow fire we need to cultivate in order to forge our good fortune with measured attention.</p>
<p class="indent">This <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> comes with a warning to not take the easy route towards embracing good fortune, as thwarting the current conditions might impede one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s destiny. We must recognise these forces, but care must be exercised, as there is a tendency in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> to associate with the wrong people and to hold unrealistic expectations.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_197"></a>The two birds clashing is also an allegory of gossip. They must be kept apart. On a practical level this is an admonition to strive towards positive public opinion, meaning that one should not encourage birds to fight. If one avoids this, one will attract the favour of the Elders of the Night, who will defend you against negative public opinion rooted in gossip and prevent unfair trials. But this demands an upright character, as given in the mystery of the <span class="small">&#8216;</span>broken stones that did not bleed.<span class="small">&#8217;</span></p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_198"></a>This verse speaks about the securing of one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s legacy, of difficult beginnings that give way to miracles and good fortune. It is as if the invitation from the Elders of the Night is a constant temptation in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>; there is a temptation to thwart bad fortune by taking shortcuts of impermanent good fortune, rather than forging a skeleton of fiery power in the cauldron of life.</p>
<p class="indent">This idea is further expressed in the importance of hands and feet, which represent balance and stability, the integration of arbor vitae and cerebellum moved to action. It is by our mind, heart, hands and feet that we are recognized as human beings. Still, there is an ambiguity here: the two triangles that form the symbol of this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, which speak of a central balance for the actions of the right hand and foot with the left hand and foot, are in this case represented by the mystery of <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> and <i><span class="small">&#7885;</span>k<span class="small">&#224;</span>n</i> (heart), which must be in alignment if we are to function in an effective and good fashion. This alignment between <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> and <i><span class="small">&#7885;</span>k<span class="small">&#224;</span>n</i> mirrors the dynamic between <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run and Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">This mystery is encoded in the ambiguous plant known as <i><span class="small">&#233;</span>tip<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>nl<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> (<i>Boerhaavia diffusa</i>) which is, in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, both taboo and a teacher plant. <i><span class="small">&#201;</span>tip<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>nl<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> possesses the properties of making land and people barren, but at the same time it is a sorcerous plant which possesses the power to attract what one desires, and is said to be especially powerful in attracting males. It also has remarkable medicinal properties: it is antibacterial, and fortifies the immune system. In this way, it represents the fine line between danger and destruction, healing and fortune, that is embedded in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>.</p>
<p class="indent">The <i>id<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> tree (<i>Terminalia glaucescens</i>), a relative of almond, is also found here. Its leaves ward off death and the negative influences of <i>ajog<span class="small">&#250;</span>ns</i>. But we find a certain ambiguity here too, as it is reputed to be a haven for <i><span class="small">&#237;</span>w<span class="small">&#237;</span>n</i>, spirits of nature similar to fairies and, to some extent, ghosts. It is antiseptic and generally useful for maintaining the hygiene of the mouth and soft organs. The <i>id<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> also attracts elephants, the animal of Erinl<span class="small">&#232;</span>, which speaks of it being a tree of wisdom. There is an interesting dynamic to be found between these two trees, in terms of how they represent the energy of this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>.</p>
<p class="indent">One verse gives us the following proverb: <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>d<span class="small">&#225;</span>k<span class="small">&#237;</span>s<span class="small">&#237;</span> <span class="small">&#7885;</span>n<span class="small">&#224;</span> n<span class="small">&#237;</span><span class="small">&#237;</span> r<span class="small">&#233;</span> <span class="small">&#232;</span>jo l<span class="small">&#8217;</span><span class="small">&#7865;</span>y<span class="small">&#237;</span>n</i>, which means, <span class="small">&#8216;</span>the hollow part of the well trod track is where the back of the snake turns crooked.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> This proverb is tied to the story of the horse (<i><span class="small">&#7865;</span><span class="small">&#7865;</span>sin</i>) and the ram (<i><span class="small">&#224;</span>gb<span class="small">&#242;</span></i>) who were called to go to the court of the <i><span class="small">&#7885;</span><span class="small">&#x0273;</span>ni</i> (king) of If<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>. Before departing, they went to their <i>awo</i> and consulted him about what awaited them there. <a id="page_199"></a>The <i>awo</i> told them that the king had been creating his own misfortune by neglecting tradition; that he had entered into such hubris that he saw no need for venerating ancestors or <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>s</i>, in fact he saw himself as being equal or superior to God himself. The <i>awo</i> told them to tell the king that he needed to change his attitude and give sacrifice to If<span class="small">&#225;</span>, his <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> and the ancestors, and change his ways. Horse and Ram set out with some anxiety over what would come from giving the king such a message, but when they came to If<span class="small">&#x0275;</span> they saw a city in shambles and a palace in distress. It was then they knew the king would listen to what they had to tell; that it was he himself who had brought this unfortunate condition upon his realm. The king prostrated himself before Horse and Ram and immediately made the necessary sacrifices. He fed If<span class="small">&#225;</span>, his <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> and the ancestors, and he changed his ways that very night, and started to treat his people with respect and generosity. It didn<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t take long before the kingdom experienced growth and good fortune.</p>
<p class="indent">This story tells of the importance of keeping one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> balanced and of continuing the legacy of one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s ancestors. The diviners coming to the king of If<span class="small">&#x0275;</span> to set things straight are represented by the Horse and the Ram, animals that have a marked relationship to royalty and in particular to <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span>. We find here a combination of the spark of spirit, represented by the ram, and the wise consideration of this spark, in the form of the horse. Ram and Horse represent a call to embrace traditional values and to be humble towards those whose shoulders we stand upon, namely the dead, <i>eg<span class="small">&#250;</span>ng<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i>, the sum of ancestry. This story speaks of the importance of lineage, succession and the traditional world view that need to be in place to truly understand the powers that are active in the world.</p>
<p class="indent">This <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> speaks of the mystery of alignment as the source of balance, of the importance of solid foundations and balanced understanding as what supports the equilibrium of the world. It is the power that supports the magnetic poles of the earth inviting alignment and harmony of heart and mind so we can discern what is good and bad for us and accept the existence of both.</p>
