<p class="chapsub">Cele&#64262;ial agriculture in the land of transformation</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_142"></a><i><span class="small">&#204;</span>w<span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> is an <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> of fire that combines consciousness and character in order to shape our identity. While <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>y<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>k<span class="small">&#250;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> is the world itself, <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>w<span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> is the lifespan of all sentient beings. It is in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> that the essence, substance and character of all things in all kingdoms takes form. We might understand <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>w<span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> as the conscious force that etches characters upon all things, the force that gave all things their <span class="small">&#8216;</span>name<span class="small">&#8217;</span> and uniqueness. This force is represented by <i>w<span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> (true indigo, <i>Indigofera tinctoria</i>).</p>
<p class="indent"><i>W<span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> represents the hottest part of the flame. Indigo is thus the colour of the fire of transformation. It is the power of <i>w<span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> that is used by the blacksmith to forge metals into tools of agriculture and war. The same energy makes the seed of <i>ogb<span class="small">&#232;</span></i> (father) and <i><span class="small">&#x025A;</span>y<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>k<span class="small">&#250;</span></i> (mother) bring new life into manifestation. Here, a play on the word <i>w<span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> needs to be understood. In Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span> society, when a king passes away, his death is never announced, rather the word <i>w<span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> is used. The word means to ascend to the upper realms, and is used instead of saying that the king has died. Literally it means that <span class="small">&#8216;</span>character returns home,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> whereas <i>w<span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> refers to <span class="small">&#8216;</span>character being born<span class="small">&#8217;</span> or <span class="small">&#8216;</span>pushed out<span class="small">&#8217;</span> into the world.</p>
<p class="indent">It is only proper that it was in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> that the world took its shape with the formation of solid land. Here in the union of light and darkness <i>oj<span class="small">&#250;</span>m<span class="small">&#x0273;</span></i> (daybreak) and <i><span class="small">&#7885;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0273;</span></i> (the 24 hour cycle) were also born.</p>
<p class="indent">The <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>d<span class="small">&#225;</span>n</i> (bat) was born in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, an animal that can navigate in darkness. It was this power that became the basis for the skills in hunting given to the lion, and to hunters. It was here that the concept of <i>oj<span class="small">&#250;</span></i> (the eye) was born. In this we include the act and art of seeing all dimensions, as well as the physical eye. It is with the eyes of <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>w<span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> that If<span class="small">&#225;</span> sees the cosmic patterns which are about to unfold and provides predictions and interpretations. Perspective upon the mystery of life came with the birth of the eye and with it the sacred palm nuts of If<span class="small">&#225;</span>, the <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>k<span class="small">&#237;</span>n</i>, representing the eyes that see into all the dimensions of existence. Hence we have one of the praise words of this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, <span class="small">&#8216;</span>four eyes,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> the number of <span class="small">&#8216;</span>eyes<span class="small">&#8217;</span> on the part of the <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>k<span class="small">&#237;</span>n</i> that opens when it sprouts. A perfect <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>k<span class="small">&#237;</span>n</i> has four eyes: one pair that look outwards, and another that looks inward.</p>
<p class="indent">In this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, we contemplate Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span>, expressed in the enigma of the spider web of choices and consequences. Here, we find the spider, with its eight legs, which is involved in the mysterious work of the divine architect and sculptor, Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span>lal<span class="small">&#224;</span>, who shapes the consciousness of men. It is from this conjunction of powers that the seer and diviner is born.</p>

These are <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>l<span class="small">&#249;</span>k<span class="small">&#242;</span></i> (woodcock), <i>ok<span class="small">&#237;</span>n ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>ge</i> (peacock), <i>agbe</i> (blue parrot) and <i>ekodid<span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> (red parrot). The feathers of these birds became symbols of authority and wisdom through <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span>. If<span class="small">&#225;</span> speaks of a time when he his supremacy was challenged. Instead of fighting back or reasoning with his opponents, he repeatedly took refuge in the forest and sought advice from the birds, with the aid of <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> and <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>. Through applying the wisdom of the birds, this critical moment was turned into a triumph, which brought him recognition. In honour of the powers that provided the solution, he adorned himself with their feathers and gained the respect of these birds that were revealed to be bringers of wisdom, good fortune and authority. The story of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> and his battle for authority is related to a proverb ascribed to this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>: <span class="small">&#8216;</span>the father of mysteries speaks with a heavy tongue.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> An admonition not to throw pearls before swine, to guard the secrets of possibility and its matrix, and to impart it only to those worthy of it. Equally, it is a call for moderation in speech and discernment in what we impart, and to whom.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#204;</span>w<span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i>, being the capacity for foresight and prophecy, is deeply related to knowledge and understanding, and in possessing these faculties we find the importance of loyalty, tact and consideration, qualities praised in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. The idea of loyalty is tied in with the idea of fidelity, and also to the idea of <span class="small">&#8216;</span>patiently weaving sweetness<span class="small">&#8217;</span> (<i><span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#236;</span>y<span class="small">&#7865;</span>h<span class="small">&#249;</span>n</i>) and possessing a consistent and truthful character. These ideas concerning loyalty and care towards people are found in the following verse:</p>

</div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_146"></a>The verse tells us that we should learn the mystery of loyalty from dogs, which are sacred to <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n and <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>nil<span class="small">&#233;</span>, and are considered to be messenger spirits and guardians. <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n was assigned dogs to walk with him, and <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span>ny<span class="small">&#236;</span>n, the spirit of herbs, has two dogs as assistants. Hence dogs represent loyalty, commitment and dedication, and demonstrate the necessity for these virtues to be cultivated so they can become part of the person possessing good character.</p>
<p class="indent">The verse also tells that we should scrutinize our <i>ak<span class="small">&#225;</span>p<span class="small">&#242;</span></i>, because the student might not always be as loyal as a dog. <i>Ak<span class="small">&#225;</span>p<span class="small">&#242;</span></i> is an interesting term, it denotes a student of If<span class="small">&#225;</span>, but it also means <span class="small">&#8216;</span>treasurer<span class="small">&#8217;</span>; in other words, an If<span class="small">&#225;</span> apprenticeship is considered to be a charge to be approached with sanctity and care. The student is someone to whom secrets and treasures are entrusted, but the breaching of trust is always a possibility during the process of developing good character. <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>w<span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> tells us that the worthy apprentice is the one who possesses dedication, honesty, humility and faith. These are traits associated with good character, and truthfulness (<i><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#242;</span><span class="small">&#243;</span>tit<span class="small">&#7885;</span></i>) in particular. It is in truthfulness as a source for developing good character we will find the source for good fortune. So, on the one hand this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> is about truthfulness and loyalty, and on the other about the absence of these virtues, which manifests in rash judgments and deception.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#204;</span>w<span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> is an energy that warns against judging something hastily or rashly. It is fire that is at the core of this vibration, and we need to understand the ways of fire in order to direct it well. It is an <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> that calls for intense scrutiny and contemplation before any judgment is passed <span class="small">&#8211;</span> we should walk the world gently, but we should also be careful in dealings with other people:</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_147"></a>Here If<span class="small">&#225;</span> advises Or<span class="small">&#237;</span>m<span class="small">&#7885;</span>n<span class="small">&#237;</span>k<span class="small">&#x0275;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span>, <span class="small">&#8216;</span>the beauty of character and consciousness,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> to make sacrifice in order to be appreciated in the world. Situations in which one is not appreciated for one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s good deeds originate in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, which draws our attention to the importance of protecting one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s good fortune. It was this predicament Bernhard of Clairvaux had in mind when he said: <span class="small">&#8216;</span>the road to Hell is paved with good intentions.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> Just because what you have and want to share in the world is a good thing doesn<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t mean it will be appreciated. The world is after all a marketplace and there is room for everyone in the marketplace, the scoundrel and thief, the oath breaker and oath maker as much as for the drunkard and sage amidst merchants both truthful and deceptive. Understanding the fire in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> will lead to discernment so that we will speak with a heavy tongue when necessary, and share in the bliss of generosity when it is proper and worthy.</p>
<p class="indent">The concept of discernment is found in several taboos concerning trees that originate in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. When this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> says these trees are taboo, it means that they are set aside for specific purposes, or to serve as reminders for specific situations and conditions. Three trees are of particular importance in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. The first is <i>id<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> (<i>Terminalia glaucescens</i>), which was chosen to serve as the <i>ir<span class="small">&#7885;</span>k<span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i>, the If<span class="small">&#225;</span> tapper. It has medicinal properties, in particular antifungal and antiseptic ones, and these qualities are honoured in the making of the <i>ir<span class="small">&#7885;</span>k<span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i>. This instrument is used to call the attention of spirits to the tray of If<span class="small">&#225;</span> and also to dispel negative vibrations. Then we have the <i>ap<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> tree (<i>Afzelia africana</i>), which was given to the world as a cure for illness, and to serve as the material for the djembe drum and for shipbuilding. Lastly we have the <i>or<span class="small">&#250;</span>pa</i> tree (<i>Hymenocardia acida</i>), which was the son of <span class="small">&#210;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span> <span class="small">&#204;</span>gb<span class="small">&#242;</span> (<span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span>). This tree yields a heart shaped bitter fruit veiled in a hymen, which is the very symbol of this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>.</p>
<p class="indent">We see in these taboos a reminder to use discernment and to ascribe proper use to appropriate elements. These trees represent a call to spirit in various ways. <i>Id<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> does it by calling the attention of spirit, <i>ap<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> does it by replicating the rhythm and heartbeat of creation, and finally <i>or<span class="small">&#250;</span>pa</i> reminds us not to let our heart turn bitter in our human journey.</p>
<p class="indent">The sacred plants in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> are mostly what we would consider weeds; they spread in spite of obstacles and resistance to their growth. Chief of them is <i>t<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>t<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i>, of which we have two types. The one mentioned most often in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> is amaranth, also known as pigweed (<i>Amaranthus hybridius</i>), which eases slow flowing menstruation and is said to aid conception. The other is meadow foxtail (<i>Alopereus <a id="page_148"></a>pratensis</i>), a weed said to make the spermatozoa stronger. Some farmers add this to the hay given to their cattle, as it arouses the cows just as it does with mares. It should be mentioned that spinach, considered a father plant, is also found here and accorded similar properties. What they all have in common is a rich concentration of iron, and in this they mimic blood and fire; hence it is in this od<span class="small">&#249;</span> that the spirit of iron, <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n, began his apprenticeship.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#192;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i> (the witches), Aj<span class="small">&#233;</span> <span class="small">&#7778;</span>aluga (the oceanic spirit of wealth) and Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span> (earth) can all be found here, together with <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> (consciousness) and If<span class="small">&#225;</span> (wisdom). These powers shaped <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>k<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i>, the coral beads worn as a regal adornment first by Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>kun and then by kings and chiefs. It is significant that the <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>k<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i> is born here, because it is solely a product of beauty, the kind of beauty these forces can create. But adorning what is ugly will not make what is ugly beautiful. Hence beauty which lacks substance is born here, as is self-centeredness. What both have in common is their focus on outer adornment when wisdom and consciousness have been abandoned. It is a constant theme in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, that you should never be distracted from seeing clearly that which you are capable of.</p>
<p class="indent">This is an <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> that speaks of the nature of consciousness. Consciousness is a conglomerate of the spiritual forces most present here: <span class="small">&#210;</span><span class="small">&#242;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>oko, the spirit of the farm, <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n, the spirit of fire and iron, and <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span>, the spirit of dream and purity.</p>
<p class="indent">One story tells how <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> gave <span class="small">&#210;</span><span class="small">&#242;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>oko the yam to plant, but he found the work difficult. He managed to obtain the secrets of smithing and the forging of metals from <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>w<span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> and started to make agricultural tools, and thus became the first farmer, hence his name, Spirit of the Farm. His origin is obscure, some say he fell from heaven, and others that he was a virtuous king in the city of <span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span>w<span class="small">&#243;</span>. What the stories of <span class="small">&#210;</span><span class="small">&#242;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>oko emphasise is that when he was a young, handsome man, he was lazy and given to drinking and was often found in bad company. However, he changed his ways, and was appointed chief and king of his city. He represents the beginning of <span class="small">&#7884;</span>gb<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>ni justice. This is based upon the lessons <span class="small">&#210;</span><span class="small">&#242;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>oko learned in his younger years. He proclaims gossip taboo and stresses the importance of allowing both sides of a case to be heard. Gossip here refers to speaking, well or ill, about anyone who is not present. If a person is accused of something it is of paramount importance that the accused should be given the opportunity to state his or her side of the story in the presence of their accusers. The judge will then assess the testimonies that are sworn to be truthful <a id="page_149"></a>in the name of <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n. Again we are confronted with the issue of being truthful, but also being gentle. It is about finding a middle path where consciousness and wisdom inform you how to take the right course of action in between the three <span class="small">&#8216;</span>ayes,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> being red as witches, white as abundance, or black as earth.

<p class="indent">This is the story of <span class="small">&#210;</span>b<span class="small">&#250;</span>k<span class="small">&#7885;</span>, the goat. He was considered to be very truthful and wise. He was always called upon to voice his opinion about important matters in the community and he always spoke the truth no matter whether the people involved ranked high or low in society. For the goat, the importance of any case was found not only in the facts but in the wisdom that underlay the facts. Goat was praised for his wisdom and clarity, and this inspired him to repeat himself constantly and to show no sensitivity to those who gathered to hear him talk and offer his wise insights. Goat loved the sound of his own voice, and didn<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t realize that he was making enemies by being truthful. But he did notice the resentment in the community and how people left his company when he started to speak. He went to an If<span class="small">&#225;</span> priest who told him that he should show caution, that truth doesn<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t need to be repeated or broadcast. Goat should be satisfied with telling the truth once; it was not his obligation to convince anyone. The If<span class="small">&#225;</span> priest told him that he had provoked two people close to him, mischievous people, who decided to blame him for their misfortune. They felt that every truth Goat told was targeting them, and so they made a plan to destroy him. These wicked people were Ek<span class="small">&#250;</span>n, the Leopard, and <span class="small">&#204;</span>kook<span class="small">&#242;</span>, the Hyena. There was nothing bad that <a id="page_150"></a>these two had not already done. In his truthful way, Goat always condemned the actions of Hyena and Leopard, and so they felt they were the target for his talk in the town and marketplace. One day they decided that they had enough and went to an If<span class="small">&#225;</span> priest with their concerns and the If<span class="small">&#225;</span> priest told them that they should turn bad into good and never do anything when they were in a state of passion. They became furious and left the priest<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s house, vowing to lure Goat out in the night so that they could kill him. However, Goat had made his prescribed sacrifice and had placed raw beef, pork and palm oil outside his door as the If<span class="small">&#225;</span> priest had advised him to give to <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>. Night fell, and Hyena was diverted from his planned meeting with Leopard by an intriguing smell coming from the house of Goat. When he saw the food placed out he considered himself blessed and started to eat it. Meanwhile Leopard grew impatient, and went to the house of Goat where he found Hyena eating food. He fell into a fury, believing that Hyena had killed Goat and started to feast on his flesh without him. The leopard attacked the hyena and killed him. But Leopard was wounded gravely in the fight and died a few days later.</p>

He noticed the resentment building around him and he sought advice; he wanted help to see what he couldn<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t see. Humility brought him rewards. Goat did not confer judgment on either adversary, he simply asked questions about the situation, he was not looking to blame anyone.

<p class="indent"><a id="page_151"></a>Perspective is born in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, the importance of which is told in the following story.

His friend <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> told him that he should not travel, that it was not a good time for it, and that bad things would happen. But <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> had set his mind on this journey and would not be dissuaded. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> told him to at least take three pieces of white clothing, <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> (shea butter) and <i><span class="small">&#7885;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#7865;</span>d<span class="small">&#250;</span>d<span class="small">&#250;</span></i> (African soap) with him. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> accepted this advice and set off on his travels.

He continued on to <span class="small">&#7884;</span>y<span class="small">&#7885;</span>. Upon entering the gates of <span class="small">&#7884;</span>y<span class="small">&#7885;</span>, he saw a beautiful, lost horse and decided to bring it as a gift to his friend <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span>. He caught the horse and as he walked into the city the king<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s soldiers arrested him, believing he was the horse thief they had been looking for. They threw him in jail and forgot about him. Any appeal to be allowed to explain his side of the story was refused. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> decided to teach <span class="small">&#7884;</span>y<span class="small">&#7885;</span> a lesson and with his mysterious magic he brought drought, barrenness and sickness to the kingdom. When he saw the misfortune, <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> went to his diviners to find a solution and they said that the origin of the misfortune was an old man kept in his prison. <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> immediately went to the prison and saw his old friend <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> there. He ordered his immediate release, took him to the river to clean him up and ordered everyone to dress in white. <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> also dressed in white to honour <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span>, and together they became <span class="small">&#210;</span><span class="small">&#242;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>oko.

<p class="indent">This verse is a call to gather together in harmony and mutual respect.

It holds implications for our legacy, the young should be taught in a spirit of wisdom and reason, our experiences in this journey will benefit their growth as much as those which they undergo. We make our world, heaven and hell together, and so we should consider wisely and discern the steps to take with a good mind and heart.</p>
<p class="indent">In a way it all goes back to the egg, a potential awaiting birth, which we can influence for good and bad, both in its gestation and when the divine life form hatches from it. In this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> the egg was born, a medicine that could both remove and create obstacles. The egg was seen as a mercurial medium resting in the womb of the moon, waiting for daybreak. The egg is a product of the five-footed hen that scattered earth across the waters in <i><span class="small">&#200;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span> Ogb<span class="small">&#232;</span></i>, and a symbol of <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> (consciousness) and <i><span class="small">&#237;</span>w<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> (character). <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>w<span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> is the child of its father and mother, in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> it is exposed to the marketplace and a whole range of influences. The egg is alternatively called <i><span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> or <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>yin</i>, depending on whether it has been fertilized with <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>w<span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> or not. The egg needs <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#x025A;</span></i> (sperm) to become something other. The word <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#x025A;</span></i> can be used as a prefix, in which case it connotes something ejected from afar. What happens here is the basis of If<span class="small">&#225;</span> alchemy, in which the whiteness of the sun represented by the sperm is fused with the lunar redness of the egg and allowed to gestate in the concealed blackness of earth. It is in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> that alchemy was born. The main metal for this process is <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>j<span class="small">&#233;</span></i> (lead), which represents longevity because it doesn<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t rot or rust. We find the same word, <i>oje</i>, used in reference to hormones that generate change, as well as any protective plasma. <a id="page_153"></a>Lead when subjected to heat will behave like mercury, but is less volatile. Lead is considered the metal of character and consciousness because of its quality of softening under heat, which is considered a sign of humility and hope. It ignites the idea that no matter how hard our consciousness is, the right amount of fire will lend it a more dynamic shape and fluidity. The result in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> is the foetus; it is the merging of white and red gestating in the black, it is the alchemical essence, it is the mystery of new beginnings. It is the milk of the sun and the blood of the moon:</p>
