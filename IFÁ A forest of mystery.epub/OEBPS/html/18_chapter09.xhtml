<p class="noindent"><a id="page_170"></a>Whilst <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>d<span class="small">&#237;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> manifests in powers such as <i>ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>kun</i> (ocean), <i>olosa</i> (lagoons) and <i><span class="small">&#242;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span></i> (moon), <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#242;</span>s<span class="small">&#249;</span>n m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> represents the rivers that flow from these bodies of water and thence through the landscape. It leads us to the idea of creating a summit of truth and stability as a focal point, to guard the stability of our consciousness in the midst of this fluid landscape. <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#242;</span>s<span class="small">&#249;</span>n</i> implies that good fortune will be ours as long as we understand and take control of all that flows forth from consciousness, whether it be in the forms of streams, rivers of lava or waterfalls.</p>
<p class="indent">The menstrual flow is one of the most important of all rivers and flowing elements. This is expressed by a variety of river deities, such as <span class="small">&#7884;</span>ya, Y<span class="small">&#x00eb;</span>m<span class="small">&#7885;</span>ja, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span>un and <span class="small">&#7884;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>. The menstrual flow is not only a token of fertility and renewal, but it also announces the mystery of the lunar cycle, and hence two concentric circles are sometimes used to represent this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. The circle within a circle, the dream within a dream, the serpent rainbow and its colourful hues of light, are symbols which express the dynamic of this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. The light born in <i><span class="small">&#200;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span> Ogb<span class="small">&#232;</span></i> is subject to transmutation in <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#242;</span>s<span class="small">&#249;</span>n</i>; the one becomes two and from this they multiply. We have a transition from the light of the sun to the light of the moon in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, as this verse says:</p>

<p class="indent">This verse captures the great alchemical mystery of <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#242;</span>s<span class="small">&#249;</span>n</i>, that everything changes, everything dies in the process of transformation, but the light that generated our unique consciousness, our <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i>, should always shine. It should shine like the moon, which is the heavenly luminary of possibility in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>.</p>
<p class="indent">In this we find an even deeper mystery, because it is here that we find the birth of the principle and <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>m<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>l<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i> known as <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>. <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> is understood to be the son of <span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#242;</span>s<span class="small">&#249;</span>n by <span class="small">&#210;</span>jiji (shadow) in <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run, and it is this power that unfolds during the process of initiating an <i>awo</i>. A <i>babal<span class="small">&#225;</span>wo</i>/<i><span class="small">&#236;</span>y<span class="small">&#225;</span>n<span class="small">&#236;</span>f<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> is considered a child of <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> in the image of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>. The name <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> denotes a connection, a link, a circuit <span class="small">&#8211;</span> a <a id="page_171"></a>river if you will <span class="small">&#8211;</span> that is rooted in the divine storehouse and is said to be the witness of destiny. This power is viewed as an invisible mist that permeates all emptiness with divine rays, a mystery that dwells within caves, and infuses the entire Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span> with wisdom. The power of <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> runs through the earth as it does in the heavens, and is the force that gives us the memory of our fate. We remember our fate by developing good character, by insisting that doing good will allow the remembrance of who we are to flow like rivers of light from the shadows and spread goodness upon earth. This is not always so easy, because the human condition brings pain, trials and shadows and this is why a guardian of our consciousness is also manifest in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>.</p>

<p class="indent">In <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#242;</span>s<span class="small">&#249;</span>n</i> we find the crossroads where we, as spiritual beings, set out on our human journey. This journey is not always easy, it can be hard to rediscover our destiny. This is why we are given a warden for our consciousness here. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#249;</span>n never experienced a human journey, and thus he and <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> retain the memory of that goodness which we came to earth to bring. It is in <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#242;</span>s<span class="small">&#249;</span>n</i> that we find the mysteries of tribulation and forgetfulness, the reasons why we have no recollection of our true home and why the human condition is the way it is: a balance between the powers of the right and those of the left.</p>
<p class="indent">If<span class="small">&#225;</span> tells that when <span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#242;</span>s<span class="small">&#249;</span>n first came to earth he failed, because he had not made the necessary sacrifices. When he made a second attempt, he performed the sacrifices, offering a rooster and a tortoise for Yeye M<span class="small">&#250;</span>w<span class="small">&#x025A;</span>, the spirit of misfortune, and a he-goat for <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>. In addition to this, he brought yams, water, palm oil, peppers, okra and tobacco and went to the palace that stands where heaven and earth meet. He found his way to the divine chamber where he met Yeye M<span class="small">&#250;</span>w<span class="small">&#x025A;</span> and asked her to listen to his wishes and grant him blessings. Yeye M<span class="small">&#250;</span>w<span class="small">&#x025A;</span> told him that it was too early in the morning to make any wishes because there <a id="page_172"></a>was no food in the house. <span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#242;</span>s<span class="small">&#249;</span>n replied that he had brought a rooster for her, which she accepted, but then she added that she also needed okra, which he also gave her. One after another she asked for all the items which he had with him <span class="small">&#8211;</span> except for the tortoise <span class="small">&#8211;</span> and he gave her everything she required. She finally asked him to kneel down to state his wishes and be granted blessings. Knowing that it was forbidden to kneel down on the floor in the palace, he wisely knelt upon the tortoise and stated his wishes, while Yeye M<span class="small">&#250;</span>w<span class="small">&#x025A;</span> went to the kitchen to start preparing the food.</p>
<p class="indent">While <span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#242;</span>s<span class="small">&#249;</span>n was on his knees, stating all the good fortune he wanted on earth, Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span> blessed him in Yeye M<span class="small">&#250;</span>w<span class="small">&#x025A;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s absence, and said that everything which he asked for would be his. Yeye M<span class="small">&#250;</span>w<span class="small">&#x025A;</span> heard that something was going on outside the palace and, as she started to walk out from the kitchen, <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> appeared to <span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#242;</span>s<span class="small">&#249;</span>n and told him to get going fast. When Yeye M<span class="small">&#250;</span>w<span class="small">&#x025A;</span> came out, she asked Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span> where <span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#242;</span>s<span class="small">&#249;</span>n had gone, and Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span> replied that he had left for earth with all his good wishes granted. Yeye M<span class="small">&#250;</span>w<span class="small">&#x025A;</span> became furious and said that he could not go before he received a portion of bad wishes and choices as well. Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span> responded that it was not his place to interfere with the wishes of people. Furious, Yeye M<span class="small">&#250;</span>w<span class="small">&#x025A;</span> ran after <span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#242;</span>s<span class="small">&#249;</span>n, singing a curse. He sang back that he had brought everything and that nothing was left out. As he neared the golden rope that would bring him to earth, Yeye M<span class="small">&#250;</span>w<span class="small">&#x025A;</span> realized that she could not stop him, so she stretched out her claws and damaged his spine with a curse. She said that, just as the eyes cannot see the back of their own body, so will he fumble around in darkness on earth in search of his good fortune. <span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#242;</span>s<span class="small">&#249;</span>n fell to the earth with a resounding crash, and he found himself unable to recall his life in <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run. The injury to his spine caused him to forget about the wishes he had made in <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run, and to this day, we carry the furrow in our spine as a memory of Yeye M<span class="small">&#250;</span>w<span class="small">&#x025A;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s anger and our forgetfulness of our divine constitution.</p>
<p class="indent">This <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> imparts another consequence of Yeye M<span class="small">&#250;</span>w<span class="small">&#x025A;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s curse to us <span class="small">&#8211;</span> namely that her children, the <i>el<span class="small">&#233;</span>n<span class="small">&#236;</span>n<span class="small">&#237;</span></i>, came to the world of humans. These are elemental spirits generated and summoned by fear. They can be understood to be our own thwarting demons, as it is our worries, our anger and our depression that call the attention of these spirits of misfortune upon us.</p>
<p class="indent">Yeye M<span class="small">&#250;</span>w<span class="small">&#x025A;</span> is the mother of the spirits of obstruction and misfortune, and we invite her children into our lives through arrogance, greed and ambition. If<span class="small">&#225;</span> understands the presence of these spirits to be rooted in fear. Fear is an emotional <a id="page_173"></a>state born from the sensation of being in peril; an expectation of hostility, danger and failure. Fear abounds in the modern world, because its worldview is formed by negative conditioning. For those of a Christian persuasion, this negative conditioning goes back to Augustine<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s dogma of original sin. The weight of this curse even surfaced in Freud<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s psychoanalytic model of human development. Freud concluded that all actors in the Western world would enter adolescent life with a certain level of neurosis, which would impair their good fortune in a host of ways. In effect he described the <i>el<span class="small">&#233;</span>n<span class="small">&#236;</span>n<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> becoming integrated into the social fabric and thus affecting the individual life.</p>
<p class="indent">Modern Western man finds himself in a hostile world and his solution is to control and dominate it. But the truth is that it is ourselves who have become hostile and hateful in a world of abundance, generosity and kindness. We dominate nature, society, strangers and whatever we find alien in an attempt to diminish our fear. This fear is the result of the forgetfulness which we have suffered from since we took our first breath. If<span class="small">&#225;</span> constantly advises us to build good character, because through goodness and kindness, by believing that we are born good and blessed, we will spread goodness upon the earth and in doing so we will deflect the <i>el<span class="small">&#233;</span>n<span class="small">&#236;</span>n<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> and welcome good fortune. We will be a source of positive change in a world infested with the children of the spirit of obstacles.</p>
<p class="indent">In several of the stanzas in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, we find such phrases as: <span class="small">&#8216;</span>Let them hear around the world that I am a good and blessed person,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> and <span class="small">&#8216;</span>When I wake up this morning I greet my <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i>, so I can receive all good fortune.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> These are about maintaining a constant remembrance of our good and blessed state, no matter how painful the trials life gives us might be. As we see from the story, <span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#242;</span>s<span class="small">&#249;</span>n came to the world good and blessed but with a challenge to realizing this state, which was caused by his considering himself too wise and great to make <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span></i>, or sacrifice.</p>
<p class="indent">It follows that arrogance is considered an impediment to good fortune in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. People under the influence of this energy can at times be perceived as wicked, and it is important that they should be attentive to the needs of others and avoid being boastful of their intellectual superiority, because this makes people feel bad, which in turn generates a negative energetic circuit.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#242;</span>s<span class="small">&#249;</span>n thought he knew everything, and considered himself to have no need for others, but If<span class="small">&#225;</span> repeatedly tells us that this is a fallacy. No man or woman is enough in themselves, we need community, friends, spouses and children to <a id="page_174"></a>sustain our good fortune and bring equilibrium to our lives. We always need those who are, or who we call, family, be they visible or invisible.</p>

It is a call to become more agile and to operate in more dynamic ways in the world, just as a powder can seep into anything anywhere while still retaining its essence.</p>
<p class="indent">The verse states that when this work is done, ancestors and <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i> can enter and fortify one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s destiny. The mystery of destiny belongs to the realm of <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> and If<span class="small">&#225;</span> as the powers that guard against the inherent confusion of mind in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. Our consciousness needs to be calm to perceive the design of its destiny. Here the ability and intellectual strength to forge one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s destiny becomes a possibility. To forge one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s destiny can be hard work, which is why <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#242;</span>s<span class="small">&#249;</span>n</i> also comes with a call for patience in this great work of self discovery. This mystery is encoded in the stories about a diviner called <span class="small">&#204;</span>gb<span class="small">&#224;</span>.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="small">&#204;</span>gb<span class="small">&#224;</span> was an <i>awo</i> in a small village in <span class="small">&#7884;</span>y<span class="small">&#7885;</span>. He was not appreciated, and struggled for money and recognition in spite of being a very knowledgeable priest. When the kingdom was plagued with smallpox, the <i>al<span class="small">&#225;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>fin</i> (king) called upon his assistance. <span class="small">&#204;</span>gb<span class="small">&#224;</span> gave a sacrifice of okra to the river deity <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span>un, along with other small sacrifices, and retreated to his humble farm in the secluded village. As a consequence, not only did the epidemic pass without causing deaths, but the kingdom experienced great success in all matters. The king went with his entourage to <span class="small">&#204;</span>gb<span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s village and rewarded him with gifts, recognition and esteem.</p>
<p class="indent">In the various versions of this story, we find that <span class="small">&#204;</span>gb<span class="small">&#224;</span> started his work as a diviner with enormous expectations of the amount of success he would experience. After all, he knew everything possible to know, but he found no success, because he came across as wicked, selfish and arrogant. Over the years he was humbled, but this didn<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t make him doubt himself or his work: rather a change of attitude occurred in which he decided that whatever he did, no matter how small, he would do well. It was this change in attitude that eventually brought him the esteem and fortune he was destined for.</p>
<p class="indent">The name <span class="small">&#204;</span>gb<span class="small">&#224;</span> refers to a calabash of mystery, like the vessels or <i>igb<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> that contain the secrets of <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i>; and it also means <span class="small">&#8216;</span>time<span class="small">&#8217;</span> and <span class="small">&#8216;</span>history.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> A calabash of mystery, as in the case of a vessel for an <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i>, is a divine ray made manifest. It is created from a particular energy with a particular history. This history is directed by Eg<span class="small">&#250;</span>ng<span class="small">&#250;</span>n as the holder of ancestral wisdom. In this understanding we encounter ideas such as transition, lineage and succession taking place as each <i>igb<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> that is passed priest to priest generates its unique history. Therefore <a id="page_176"></a><i>eg<span class="small">&#250;</span>ng<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i> lies at the root of the mystery of <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i>, because <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i> takes its shape upon the bones of ancestry and wisdom.</p>
<p class="indent">If we feel that our intellectual capacity is outstanding compared to that of others, we can easily believe that we are superior to them, and this creates distance between ourselves and other people. Physical beauty can cause similar negative reactions. An example of this is found in the tales of the beautiful woman Aw<span class="small">&#243;</span>jig<span class="small">&#237;</span> (the mystery of reflection), who rejected all of her suitors because she found them inferior in beauty to herself and therefore not worthy of her hand. Aw<span class="small">&#243;</span>jig<span class="small">&#237;</span> used her beauty to manipulate her surroundings and gain favours by cultivating this separation between herself and others. When she was confronted with the possibility of the extinction of her memory and the loneliness which lay ahead, she changed her attitude. Her <i>awo</i> told her that: <span class="small">&#8216;</span>No matter how big the mirror is, it cannot perceive the reflection of one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s future. One<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s true mirror is one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s spouse and children.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> Reflecting upon this wisdom, she decided to marry one of the many men courting her and gave birth to a baby girl, just as beautiful as her, and thus her legacy was continued and she embraced a happy destiny of love.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#242;</span>s<span class="small">&#249;</span>n</i> is the <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> of <span class="small">&#7884;</span>y<span class="small">&#7885;</span> state in Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span>land. <span class="small">&#7884;</span>y<span class="small">&#7885;</span> gained prestige through woodcarving and military excellence. Countless wars and invasions and many ruthless rulers occur in the history of this state. By extension, this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> is the energy that sparked the birth of the famous fourth <i>al<span class="small">&#225;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>fin</i> (king) of <span class="small">&#7884;</span>y<span class="small">&#7885;</span>, <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span>.

It is in truth the energy that infuses the warrior with skill, determination and power.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> was directly related to <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>ranmiy<span class="small">&#225;</span>n, the <i>al<span class="small">&#225;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>fin</i> of this state. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>ranmiy<span class="small">&#225;</span>n was the son of Od<span class="small">&#249;</span>duw<span class="small">&#224;</span>, who became the first <i>al<span class="small">&#225;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>fin</i> of <span class="small">&#7884;</span>y<span class="small">&#7885;</span>, followed by Agayu and then by <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> himself. These are all famous <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>s</i> in Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span> mythopoetics, which underlines the importance of <i>eg<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i> (ancestry) as a prerequisite for becoming <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i>. The <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>gb<span class="small">&#224;</span></i> of <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> will consequently be the product not only of the powers of lightning, but also of this particular history and succession, going back to <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>ranmiy<span class="small">&#225;</span>n, just as it stretches on to the present day priests of <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">An important metaphysical principle is encoded here: that our <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> is directly related to <i>eg<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i> in such a way that we can become <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i> through our human journey. <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> is a great example of how ancestry, <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> and destiny are the components that make <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i> possible. In this case by transformation through fire, and we see here the blueprint of the original <span class="small">&#8216;</span>rite du passage.<span class="small">&#8217;</span></p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_179"></a><span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> is conceived of as an idea in <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>w<span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i>; in <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#242;</span>s<span class="small">&#249;</span>n</i> he gains his powers, thunder and lightning, and he sets out upon the path of destiny. In <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i>, he assumes kingship and he abuses his power, leading to his ritual suicide and elevation in <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>k<span class="small">&#224;</span>nr<span class="small">&#224;</span>n m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i>. The essential nature of <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> demonstrates a coming together of energetic forces in time, and lead to the unfolding of his history, to generate his <i>igb<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> or calabash of mystery.</p>
<p class="indent">When we discuss <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i>, we will see how the power of the warrior king, exemplified by the ideal form of <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span>, can turn into a poison in which power can arouse and intoxicate in such a way that one forfeits one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s destiny and instead reaps misfortune. In many respects, <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> typifies the fiery essence of the zodiacal sign of Aries, of which Bonatti said: <span class="small">&#8216;</span>And this is the first being by which the fiery signs are said to act, and they even act in the fiery element<span class="small">&#8217;</span> (i.e. they act in a fiery way upon all things) (Bonatti 2007:30).</p>
<p class="indent">The spirit known as <span class="small">&#7884;</span>l<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>gbun (the owner of the deep grave) came to earth as a consequence of Yeye M<span class="small">&#250;</span>w<span class="small">&#x025A;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s curse, and manifested the potential for danger and games of chance. The verses describe this power as red, hot and dark, and say that its redness has a dry quality. This spirit represents the pit prepared for those who venerate their arrogance in such a way that they lose contact with the earth and turn their attention solely towards their inner divine fire as a solipsistic glory. It is also a warning that accidents can happen to anyone.</p>
<p class="indent">One story tells of how <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> fell into the clutches of <span class="small">&#7884;</span>l<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>gbun when he was travelling to a city to help the inhabitants. He had however made <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span></i> before going, and so he went on his journey with a large amount of cotton, as his diviner had told him to do. As he ventured through the woods he fell into a deep hole and was saved by the cotton he was carrying. He shouted out for help as he lay there, and it so happened that three women heard his lament and helped him from the grave. Some stories say that these women were Ab<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#249;</span>, Ab<span class="small">&#243;</span>y<span class="small">&#232;</span> and Ab<span class="small">&#x0273;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#237;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#x0275;</span>, who became <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s wives. Others say that they were <span class="small">&#7884;</span>ya, Y<span class="small">&#x00eb;</span>m<span class="small">&#7885;</span>ja and <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span>un, and both accounts are right. Ab<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#249;</span>, Ab<span class="small">&#243;</span>y<span class="small">&#232;</span> and Ab<span class="small">&#x0273;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#237;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#x0275;</span> are of a similar essence to <span class="small">&#7884;</span>ya, Y<span class="small">&#x00eb;</span>m<span class="small">&#7885;</span>ja and <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span>un, but in this case they appear as powers of elevation and blessing. The phrase <span class="small">&#8216;</span>Ab<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#249;</span>, Ab<span class="small">&#243;</span>y<span class="small">&#232;</span>, Ab<span class="small">&#x0273;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#237;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#x0275;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span> is used to greet an <i>awo</i>, in reference to the female powers that elevated <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> from the grave. These three names are a call for the <i>awo</i> to take the burden of the person greeting him upon his shoulders <span class="small">&#8211;</span> a burden which the <i>awo</i> then lifts to <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run. It reminds us that the female powers elevate us from darkness, a remembrance we find in the attire of <a id="page_180"></a><span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span>, who wears his apron in the manner of a woman to remind himself of the source of his support and aid; a remembrance worthy of any man.</p>
<p class="indent">Danger in all its forms is made manifest in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> and symbolized by the colour red, which we assign to anger and emotional turmoil. Red metals (gold, copper, bronze), red clay and <i>os<span class="small">&#249;</span>n</i> (camwood), as well as the colour red itself should be used with caution, in case they lead to accidents, anger, fire and thunder. Redness is a token of the appetite of <span class="small">&#7884;</span>l<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>gbun, and thus should be avoided when one sets out to find one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s self and pursue one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s fate.</p>
<p class="indent">In the forest of mystery we find two trees that bring the good fortune promised in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. The first is the <i>ak<span class="small">&#242;</span>ko</i> (<i>Chamaesyce olowaluana</i>/<i>Newbouldia laevis</i>), a relative of Croton (<i>Croton dictyophlebodes</i>), which has the power to reveal treasures and good fortune. This tree is crucial for initiations into If<span class="small">&#225;</span>, just as it is for Eg<span class="small">&#250;</span>ng<span class="small">&#250;</span>n, and it is often used to decorate the groves of <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n and mark sacred places. It represents bounty and victory, and has remarkably calmative properties. The tree itself might not appear glorious, but its orchid-like flowers bear witness to its glory, as does its ability to adapt and remain healthy even through ruthless climatic changes. It is the very symbol of the <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, standing strong and bestowing medicinal bounty; irrespective of the conditions surrounding it, and whosoever decides to partake of its gifts.</p>
<p class="indent">The other sacred tree in <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#242;</span>s<span class="small">&#249;</span>n</i> is the banana palm (<i>Musaceae</i> family), which is a symbol of everlasting safety and truthfulness. The banana palm is the mirror axis between the society in heaven and that on earth, and is the tree spoken off repeatedly in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. What is curious about the banana palm is that it is not a true palm, it procreates by the mother axis rising from the centre of its roots to spread her children around her feet, giving the illusion that it is the same plant producing fruits again and again, while it is in reality a series of mirrors stemming from the mother. This natural capacity, to mirror, lies behind its association with <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>b<span class="small">&#237;</span>k<span class="small">&#250;</span></i>. This speaks about the society in heaven that mirrors the society in Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span>. If<span class="small">&#225;</span> believes that we all have a double in heaven, who can either call us back home or bless our journey on earth. It is at the foot of the banana palm that we renew our pacts and agreements to live long, and see our hair turn white.</p>
<p class="indent">The idea of balanced opposites finds its form in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. An example is Crocodile, who complained about having only its big jaws and slow armoured body, and so it was given a tail to move more effectively. Another balanced opposite is in the mystery of our two hands, we need to have the hand of welcome as <a id="page_181"></a>well as the hand of defence in order to realize our blessings. <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#242;</span>s<span class="small">&#249;</span>n</i> is the <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> of paradox, and the spiritual force of contrast and paradox finds its expression in <i><span class="small">&#242;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>m<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#233;</span></i> and the spiritual concept of <i><span class="small">&#x0275;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span>ra</i> as related to <span class="small">&#7864;</span>gb<span class="small">&#x00eb;</span>, the society in heaven to which we return through uniting our flesh and body with Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span> and ascending on the bones of <i>eg<span class="small">&#250;</span>ng<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i>. <i><span class="small">&#x011a;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span>ra</i> is also a term used for our spiritual doubles in <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run. <i><span class="small">&#x011a;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span>ra</i> are commonly understood to be either spirits of misfortune, or spirits that underlie the aggressive aspects of the warrior spirit. These are reflections of a deeper metaphysical mystery concerned with the stability of the earth. If<span class="small">&#225;</span> reveals that when Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span> endowed the earth with her spirit and soul, there was a need for forces that would stabilize it. The first of these spirits that would ensure stability was Eg<span class="small">&#249;</span>ng<span class="small">&#249;</span>n, which gave a bonelike structure to earth and marked the four seasons. <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>, <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#x0273;</span><span class="small">&#x025A;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#236;</span> and <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>ranmiy<span class="small">&#225;</span>n/<span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> came to this crossroads of bone as powers to protect this stability.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#210;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>m<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#233;</span></i> is the rainbow, symbolizing the bridge between Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span> and <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run. In some districts in Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span>land, he is also known as <span class="small">&#7884;</span>l<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>. This is a term of some ambiguity, as it means the <span class="small">&#8216;</span>owner of rain,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> but it can also refer to him being the owner of time, as in the changing days of a week. It contains a further reference to his eyes showing themselves through rain; hence, when the sun and the rain appear at the same time, we have a manifestation of <span class="small">&#210;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>m<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#233;</span> in the rainbow.</p>
<p class="indent">Here is the power that influences all cycles and shifts in conditions, whether temporary or permanent. As such, this force influences the phases of the moon, the menstrual cycles, the night turning into day and even the biometric polarity inherent in If<span class="small">&#225;</span> divination as the active presence of Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span>. <span class="small">&#210;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>m<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#233;</span> is at times considered an <i><span class="small">&#x0275;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span>ra</i>, and given a particular alchemical secret that makes part of its calabash of mystery. This secret consists of turning mercury into a solid stone with the aid of five secret herbs flanked by seven metals. This mystery is related to that of <span class="small">&#7884;</span>l<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0273;</span> as time keeper and historian.</p>
<p class="indent">One story tells of <span class="small">&#210;</span>j<span class="small">&#242;</span> (rain), who was a dark and sombre, but very generous man who gave his waters to friend and foe alike. He was reputed to be as ruthless as he was generous. He had a beautiful wife, J<span class="small">&#242;</span>j<span class="small">&#242;</span>l<span class="small">&#243;</span>, who gave beauty to fog, moisture and dew, and was his constant companion. It so happened that In<span class="small">&#225;</span> (fire) came to earth and tried to seduce J<span class="small">&#242;</span>j<span class="small">&#242;</span>l<span class="small">&#243;</span>. She was intrigued and decided to have a divination. The <i>babal<span class="small">&#225;</span>wo</i> said that there was no need to try a new husband just to discover that the one she already had was perfect for her, and advised her to make a sacrifice to <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> to avoid calamity. J<span class="small">&#242;</span>j<span class="small">&#242;</span>l<span class="small">&#243;</span> was very beautiful <a id="page_182"></a>and much loved, so she decided to take a chance and didn<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t make the sacrifice. She and In<span class="small">&#225;</span> became lovers. The relationship was enormously exciting, but also uncomfortable, because the fire suffocated J<span class="small">&#242;</span>j<span class="small">&#242;</span>l<span class="small">&#243;</span>, and made her dry. After a time she tried to avoid In<span class="small">&#225;</span>, who became infuriated and captured her in a ring of fire to make her his forever. Finding herself in peril she cried out to <span class="small">&#210;</span>j<span class="small">&#242;</span>, who heard her and gave abundantly of his gifts. The fire disappeared and, rejoicing, she set off to reunite with her husband. As she embarked on her journey home, she fell into a pit of burning embers, to which In<span class="small">&#225;</span> had retreated, a place where rain could not fall. She was burned and crippled, and from her ashen body were born the earthworms that go forth in search of moist soil.</p>
<p class="indent">This story imparts many mysteries to us, one being the importance that <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> holds in the divine design and in that of our lives. It speaks of how generosity and kindness always defeat even the most fiery of opponents, and it also speaks of the need for sacrifice. In this case J<span class="small">&#242;</span>j<span class="small">&#242;</span>l<span class="small">&#243;</span> believed that her beauty and erotic appeal would save her from danger, and so she set out to follow her passions, discarding concern because of the arrogance born from her beauty.</p>
<p class="indent">Many of the stanzas in <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#242;</span>s<span class="small">&#249;</span>n</i> teach us to be careful in our actions, in case we do something that we will regret for the rest of our lives. Because of a feeling of superiority, whether of beauty or intellect, disaster strikes and humbles the self-centred traveller. This is poignantly illustrated by a story that speaks of how rats and mice became so fertile. They had become accustomed to do as they liked, there were few threats in the world which they could not hide. One day Cat arrived on earth. When Mouse saw Cat for the first time, he immediately recognized the danger, but instead of succumbing to fear, he walked past the cat and said, <span class="small">&#8216;</span>What works for me might not work for you, what works for you might not work for me.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> Cat stopped Mouse and engaged him in conversation, asking what he meant by that. Mouse said that Cat might look upon him as food or something to play with, but this would make him lose sight of the greater picture. Cat just laughed and told him that he could end him any day with his sharp teeth and fierce claws, that it was in his nature to kill and eat <span class="small">&#8211;</span> or play <span class="small">&#8211;</span> with the mouse. Mouse questioned Cat, asking if that was all he was, just a hungry killing machine, or could there be more to their predicament than this simple logic? Cat became annoyed by the philosophical rhetoric of Mouse, and told him that we all do what we are designed to do. He was larger and far more lethal than Mouse, so it was natural that Mouse should serve as play and food for him. Mouse responded <a id="page_183"></a>that it might be true, but it was still important to pay attention to the bigger picture. Cat became even more annoyed, and was about to finish this conversation when he felt a sharp pain in his neck as the watchful viper behind him struck. Arrogance, and its repercussions, is the constant theme in <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#242;</span>s<span class="small">&#249;</span>n</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">In this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, If<span class="small">&#225;</span> states the importance of setting aside a piece of land that remains untouched, so <i><span class="small">&#237;</span>w<span class="small">&#237;</span>n</i> can reside there. This is a testament of respect to <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>nil<span class="small">&#233;</span>, and a call for harmonious coexistence. Everything begins and ends in <i>igb<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, the forest of mystery. In this we find the lesson of taking what is ours and respecting what does not belong to us, we are the keepers of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>nil<span class="small">&#233;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s mysteries.</p>
<p class="indent">Having understood these lessons, we can come to appreciate a key stanza in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, which speaks about the beginning of the human journey:</p>

<p class="indent">It is from here that we set out on our human journey bathed in honey, sweet water, and the goodness of the morning dew.
