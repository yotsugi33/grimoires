<p class="noindent"><a id="page_293"></a><i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> is named after a man known as <span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>. This man was a spiritual pilgrim, always searching for enlightenment. He was devout in his practice and kept diligently to his spiritual routine. Whenever he made sacrifice he always doubled up on what he was told to offer or do. As a consequence, <span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span> experienced tremendous abundance both from the dwellers in <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run and from those in Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span>. He was blessed with abundance, prosperity and all the good things which life on earth would give, just as he was blessed with unparalleled understanding and insight about the ways of heaven. Hence, this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> is commonly applied to prophets. Chief Adewuyi says the meaning of the name <span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span> relates to an active search to gain freedom by attracting peace, love and harmony.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#192;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>, the second part of the word making up the name of the <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> means <span class="small">&#8216;</span>body,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> and thus we have the meaning of the ensouled being searching for freedom and becoming filled with harmony.</p>
<p class="indent">The idea of a prophet in If<span class="small">&#225;</span> is related to the capacity of passing on foresight. The Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span> word for a prophecy is <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>s<span class="small">&#7885;</span>t<span class="small">&#x0276;</span>l<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i>, which signifies <span class="small">&#8216;</span>matters concerning the future which happen beneath a veil or cloth where a given condition is addressed in mysterious ways.<span class="small">&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="indent">This <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> announces the arrival of Muslims, or strangers, into Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span>land. In the corpus of If<span class="small">&#225;</span>, the Muslims accomplished mastery of If<span class="small">&#225;</span> due to their spiritual discipline. The Muslim <i>kasan</i> (<i>kaftan</i>) represents the cloth of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span>, which serves as a reminder of the importance of clothing yourself in whiteness and seeking contemplation and spirit communion to attract harmony and understanding. In relation to spiritual discipline, one of the verses in the combinations of <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> (<span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span>r<span class="small">&#x00eb;</span>t<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>) says:</p>

<p class="indent">The verse stresses the inherent quality of this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, that is, the ability to shed one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s skin and to ascend in wisdom and understanding through the possession of humility, direction, and an upright character. It is here that <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> came to be praised as <span class="small">&#8216;</span>the upright one,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> which will be further addressed in the final chapter <a id="page_294"></a>of this book. <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> is particularly favoured by Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span>, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> and <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> on account of this constellation of virtues, along with the capacity to examine all things in order to disclose wisdom, power and destiny.</p>
<p class="indent">In <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> we find several references to mythological themes and ages, for it is an <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> of fairytales. One of these is referred to by Osamoro Ibie (1986), who recounts a lengthy story in which <span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span> fought a dragon in a way strikingly similar to the popular legends of St George and his chivalric deeds across the Campo Stella and his slaying <span class="small">&#8211;</span> or taming <span class="small">&#8211;</span> of the dragon. It is significant that this legend is found here, in relation to another deed ascribed to <span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span> <span class="small">&#8211;</span> namely how the first <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>m<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>l<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i> he brought from <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run to earth was <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>. <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> is commonly translated as <span class="small">&#8216;</span>the spirit of salvation,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> <span class="small">&#8216;</span>the pure one<span class="small">&#8217;</span> or simply <span class="small">&#8216;</span>grace.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> is the spirit of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> <span class="small">&#8211;</span> in other words, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> is an incarnation of <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>. <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> himself is described as mystery and is said to be manifest in the sparkles of light found in caves and subterranean tunnels, which represent the mysterious and hidden dimensions of wisdom itself.</p>
<p class="indent">This <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> also tells how <span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span> made <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span></i> at the four corners of the world when he came to earth, and established the necessary equilibrium and harmony between the elemental powers which support Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span>, symbolized by the four corners of the divination tray. In the practice of this <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span></i> he established the presence of <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span> al<span class="small">&#224;</span></i> within Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span>. The <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span> al<span class="small">&#224;</span></i>, or <i>igb<span class="small">&#225;</span> al<span class="small">&#224;</span></i>, holds the memory of the prophetic dream, and this is what was spread throughout the caves that were prepared as a dwelling for <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>. This being done, the veins of the earth became rich with wisdom and oracular potency.</p>
<p class="indent">In relation to this story, P<span class="small">&#243;</span>p<span class="small">&#243;</span><span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> makes mention of <i><span class="small">&#7885;</span>gb<span class="small">&#224;</span> it<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>r<span class="small">&#242;</span></i>, which he translates as <span class="small">&#8216;</span>the Garden of Halcyon in <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> that serves as a memento for what <span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span> established on earth. This refers to the kingfisher and to Alcyone, the star considered to be the leader of the Pleiades, and the <i><span class="small">&#7885;</span>gb<span class="small">&#224;</span> it<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>r<span class="small">&#242;</span></i> is the dream of the first Eden. And here, in the field of stars, is the theme of St George and his adventures, where the myths of the kingfisher and the Pleiades provide a stellar background for <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> and what it attracts. It is pertinent to take a closer look at these themes.</p>
<p class="indent">The halcyon is the kingfisher, a bird sacred in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. We know from Greek legends that the kingfisher represents abundance, peace, protection and love. The legend tells how Alcyone, the daughter of Aeolus, the ruler of the winds, upon finding her husband drowned, drowned herself in the ocean. She was resurrected <a id="page_295"></a>as the kingfisher and upon her resurrection, her father decreed the winds to be still on the seven days before and after the December solstice. These are known as Halcyon Days and are associated with the mythical idea of the kingfisher making a floating nest on the ocean where its eggs could gestate and hatch without threat from wind or beast. Alcyone was adored by the Nereids, especially Thetis, and other sea nymphs and mermaids. Alcyone is the leader of the Pleiades, the seven sisters. Her name means <span class="small">&#8216;</span>The queen who wards off evil winds<span class="small">&#8217;</span> and is related to the Garden of Hesperides. These garden motifs are interesting because <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> speaks of a first creation of the world, a golden age infused with nymphs, beauty and love. P<span class="small">&#243;</span>p<span class="small">&#243;</span><span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> comments that <span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span> is venerated by the <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#7865;</span>s</i> and Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span> on account of his efforts in this first creation.</p>
<p class="indent">The original designer of the first creation was <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>. It was perfect, and the world was inhabited by <i><span class="small">&#232;</span>n<span class="small">&#236;</span>y<span class="small">&#224;</span>n</i>, but these spirits in human form were taken back for a reason not clearly stated, and another type of <i><span class="small">&#232;</span>n<span class="small">&#236;</span>y<span class="small">&#224;</span>n</i> was placed on earth instead. <span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span> was appointed to be the overseer of both these phases, and his efforts and wisdom in executing, planning and supervising the design led to his being celebrated and to his association with harmony, love and perfection.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> is first and foremost concerned with design, perfection and character, themes found in a story said to occur in the time when <span class="small">&#8216;</span>the trees were our ancestors.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> This <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> speaks of the <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>rinm<span class="small">&#7885;</span>do</i> tree (<i>Ricinodendron heudelotii</i>), also known as <i>njangsa</i>. It is a majestic tree with thick and deep roots and a prominent crown on a greyish trunk that can reach 50 metres in height. The seed kernels are used both as oil and as a flavouring agent, having a taste reminiscent of a slightly peppery groundnut. Its medicinal qualities are many; an infusion prepared from the bark is used to drive away poison and illnesses, such as fevers and malaria. The presence of the tree is beneficial for the soil and it is rarely plagued by pests and insects aside from a few types of caterpillar which exist in symbiosis with it, amongst them the moth <i>Imbrasia obscura</i> whose markings, reminiscent of two red eyes on its dark wings, make it the subject of legends which tell of what is strange.</p>
<p class="indent">The myth of <span class="small">&#7864;</span>rinm<span class="small">&#7885;</span>do tells of how her beauty and majesty attracted enemies, leading to her not having any success in spite of her many wonderful qualities. This was in the time when the trees were our ancestors. She didn<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t perform any evil, nor wish ill upon her enemies. Time passed and the conspiracy against her became more serious, so she decided to go to her <i>awo</i> for divination to see what <a id="page_296"></a>could be done. The <i>awo</i> told her to make a sacrifice so that she would become the queen of her enemies and rule them. She did as the <i>awo</i> advised, and in a short time her enemies came to her with their suffering and appointed her the ruler of all the trees, accepting her beauty and majesty to be eternal.</p>
<p class="indent">This story serves as a reminder that one should show exemplary character at all times and not wish one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s enemies ill, no matter how wicked they are, because often those who do wickedness do so because they suffer inwardly. We are told more of <span class="small">&#7864;</span>rinm<span class="small">&#7885;</span>do and the presence of wickedness in another story, in which we meet an <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> called Alukandi, <span class="small">&#8216;</span>He who travels back and forth bringing news.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> Alukandi was appointed to be Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s overseer of human affairs and to report back on what was going on across the earth. Alukandi executed his assignment dutifully, and reported everything he saw. As time passed, Alukandi grew bitter and confused at the state of the world. He couldn<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t understand why these people were fighting and bickering, destroying nature and behaving in selfish ways. Why should they be allowed to live? He brought his concerns to Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span>, but Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span> told him that he should not interfere. Alukandi accepted Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s words, but his bitterness grew into hatred until, one day he asked for the power to kill and dominate. Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span> gave them to him. He gave him the power <i><span class="small">&#7885;</span>f<span class="small">&#x025A;</span> <span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#7865;</span></i>, which is the power of the word, the power of enchantments and <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>b<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> (curses) represented by the <i>at<span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#225;</span>r<span class="small">&#233;</span></i> (alligator pepper). Alukandi assumed human shape and he took form in the midst of the market. Here he spoke to the people, telling them that mercy, pity and grace had come to an end, and it was now time for retribution. Having stated this, he started to kill them. He spread fear and havoc everywhere.</p>
<p class="indent">The day after the mass killing, people came to the market to collect the bodies of their loved ones. When they saw that Alukandi was still there, they approached him and tried to reason with him, but he responded, <span class="small">&#8216;</span>I, Alukandi, am here now, and whoever I want to kill, I will surely kill.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> Tragedy spread across the city as Alukandi killed off the population one by one in an attempt of rid the city of wickedness. The confusion Alukandi created drew the attention of <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>, who went to the market to see what was going on and tried to reason with him. Alukandi told him that his powers were given by divine decree and that he would do what was best for the earth. After an attempt at dialogue, <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> told him that his assignment was to oversee, not to interfere, and so he went to the <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#7865;</span>s</i> and told them about Alukandi<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s misuse of his powers. Other <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#7865;</span>s</i> went to <a id="page_297"></a>the market to witness what <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> had reported, and when they saw that Alukandi was indeed misusing his powers they made sacrifice to <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> and asked him to take the powers away. The very same night <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> went to the sleeping Alukandi and stripped him of his powers. On the following day, he went to the market once again with his intent to kill the wicked, but this time nothing happened. People rapidly noticed that his powers were lost and saw him for what he truly was, a man consumed by bitter hatred, and so they turned against him and sent him back to where he came from.</p>
<p class="indent">The story of Alukandi mirrors that of <span class="small">&#7864;</span>rinm<span class="small">&#7885;</span>do, speaking of the consequences of acting against wickedness in a spirit of self-righteousness and vengeance. <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> brings us the message that wickedness will eventually collapse in on itself and highlights the importance of maintaining an upright character when confronted with it. Alukandi is someone who has been consumed by the negativity of the world and has turned to vengeance and terror; whilst <span class="small">&#7864;</span>rinm<span class="small">&#7885;</span>do represents one who seeks to deal with a hostile situation in a way that does not feed and increase negativity. In <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> it is taboo to wish evil upon our enemies, and at times it is said that this taboo is only for people born in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, but in truth, this is a taboo for any <i>awo</i>. The reason for this is that the <i>awo</i> has access to powers that bring cataclysm, but these powers should never be used lightly. In fact, If<span class="small">&#225;</span> is adamant that if violence appears to be the way to deal with a situation, then you have not investigated the range of solutions deeply enough. Rather, it is a guiding rule for the <i>awo</i> to behave like <span class="small">&#7864;</span>rinm<span class="small">&#7885;</span>do.</p>
<p class="indent">Another proverb from <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> tells us: <span class="small">&#8216;</span> <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> is the father of the lie, but <span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span> is its mother.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> is so beloved by Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span> and <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> that all forms of power can be attracted in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>; with this comes the temptation to manipulate events and misuse powers. <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> is the power that can reduce the wickedness in <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> to nothing or magnify it a thousand times by the use of the word and tongue. In <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> the word was born, but in <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> the secrets of using the word with power and direction are revealed. Hence, this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> speaks about how lies will attract the negative vibrations of <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> into <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> and generate wickedness.</p>
<p class="indent">This <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> is concerned with the virtue of remaining sweet and comforting, being a solace in the world, in spite of the ways in which people misbehave. <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> speaks of the necessity of recognizing the existence of enemies and detractors, but the importance of not responding to them on the same terms. We need to make sure that their negativity does not affect and contaminate us. In <a id="page_298"></a>recognising our detractors, we need to acknowledge the power of the word and use our thoughts, tongue and breath to bless the world, whilst watching our own tongues. <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> is not only concerned with the lie, but also with the overuse of words, hence it is important to avoid gossip and protect secrets here. This theme is illustrated by the talkative squirrel:</p>

<p class="indent">The verse speaks about being careful with our words, because not everyone we meet seeks our well-being, and sharing joy and love can sometimes call upon their negative manifestations, misery and envy. At the same time, <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> advises <a id="page_300"></a>treating everyone we meet well. One proverb says: <span class="small">&#8216;</span>If<span class="small">&#225;</span> does not recognize king or beggar, as the machete does not recognize its maker.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> It is about being aware of the energies at play so that we can avoid judgment, regret and hatred. If we assess a situation properly, we will understand how to conduct ourselves, so that harmony can reign. In the story of the squirrel who shared his joy at the birth of twins, his happiness invoked the envy of the barren and the hatred of those who saw him as undeserving.</p>
<p class="indent">The temptation towards lies and deception enters with a natural ease. When these situations occur, we need to be aware that falsehood is transient and that truth will always overcome it, as long as we are patient. This reminder should serve as an encouragement to give other people a chance and to be an example of good character ourselves, so that we can attract those who are drawn towards good character, and distance ourselves from those who impede good fortune. <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> warns against speaking too loudly about one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s good fortune even as it invites us to exercise hospitality and generosity. We never know the true identity of the guest who comes to our house or the beggar to whom we give charity. <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> confers immense power, but it is not always necessary to exercise the power one holds, in this way the od<span class="small">&#249;</span> symbolizes the ideal of a ruler.</p>
<p class="indent">These qualities are given to the <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span></i> tree (<i>Ceiba pentandra</i>), which is taboo in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. This tree is a renowned leader, and yet taboo here as <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> is the <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> of the wise counsellor and not the <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> typically given to royal fame and dominion. <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> is the architect and the traveller, the inventor and designer, the wisdom of the crown.</p>
<p class="indent">It is in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> that the designer of individual consciousness, <span class="small">&#192;</span>j<span class="small">&#224;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span>, is found. His name means <span class="small">&#8216;</span>dog of whiteness<span class="small">&#8217;</span>; the dog being associated with <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n and <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>nil<span class="small">&#233;</span>, representing both comfort and the hunt. We might understand <span class="small">&#192;</span>j<span class="small">&#224;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> as being the force that invests our consciousness with the ability to search and hunt for our destiny as much as the faculty of finding rest and joy in whiteness and peace.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="small">&#192;</span>j<span class="small">&#224;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> is not only a divinely skilled artist, but is also described as a drunkard and a debtor. This fusion of extraordinary talent and the confusion and carelessness of his drunkenness leads to not all the or<span class="small">&#237;</span>s or heads he makes being of a good quality. Since he is constantly in debt it is also possible to bargain and bribe him, but this is not a guarantee that he will give you a good <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i>. A good <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> is a consciousness naturally inclined towards peace, tranquillity, harmony and love.</p>

When going to the house of <span class="small">&#192;</span>j<span class="small">&#224;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span>, the choice of <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> can complicate or facilitate our human journey. If<span class="small">&#225;</span> speaks here of how challenges are necessary in order for us to realize our fate. What happens in <span class="small">&#192;</span>j<span class="small">&#224;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s sculpting grove is quite typical of the human condition. In If<span class="small">&#225;</span>, fate is not a preordained script, rather it is associated with the accomplishment of abundance, joy, happiness and love and the 256 patterns (<i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span>s</i>) available for us with which to reach the fullness of what life can give. Our consciousness is fashioned in <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> and born or given in <i><span class="small">&#200;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span> Ogb<span class="small">&#232;</span></i>.</p>
<p class="indent">When we enter <span class="small">&#192;</span>j<span class="small">&#224;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s workshop, we have already stated our purpose to Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span>. In other words, we have defined the <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> in which we want to incarnate as human beings. The <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> of birth gives a certain quality to our journey which is regulated by taboo and recommendations. Each <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> is regulated by a precise and unique rhythm that can be inhibited or cultivated. If we possess good character, we will possess all things. If we are peaceful, loving and joyous we will naturally attract our fate, which is to be happy, content and accomplished.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> recommends meditation and regular fasting as tools to develop good character, especially in periods of confusion and doubt, as these bring clarity and abundance. These solutions are inspired by the Muslims, who became exemplars of good character and devotion in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. Both the <i>kasan</i> and the minaret are attributed to <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>; the <i>kasan</i> represents the cloth of whiteness that brings dream and prophecy, and the minaret represents the prayerful upright character so important in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> is occupied with discourse and diplomacy, philosophy and social theories. It is from the influence of <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> that <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> received the praise name <span class="small">&#8216;</span>The divine linguist.<span class="small">&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="indent">All these features are represented by the <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>l<span class="small">&#249;</span>k<span class="small">&#233;</span></i> (<i>Eurasian woodcock</i>). She was a very hardworking bird, and Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span> took great delight in watching her. She always did her work dutifully and paid attention to her spiritual life, but she felt that she enjoyed no increase as a result, and so she went to her <i>awo</i> for a divination. He told her that she was blessed, that she should continue as she did, to work hard and observe her spiritual disciplines, but that she should also love and respect others, no matter whether they deserved it or not. She did as she was advised and experienced success, popularity, abundance and wealth. This <a id="page_304"></a>bird is sacred to Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>kun and Aj<span class="small">&#233;</span> <span class="small">&#7778;</span>aluga, spirits of wealth that are present in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> and can provide monetary abundance and prosperity.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> is as much the <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> of true love as it is of misanthropy. There is a tendency here to be so disappointed with humankind that we reject goodness and invite bitterness to take its place, but the <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> also reveals that finding your soul-mate is a cure against these misanthropic tendencies. We find here the story of S<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#250;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#224;</span> (the sandal) who felt he was incomplete. One day he met <span class="small">&#7864;</span>s<span class="small">&#x0275;</span> (the foot), and he just knew that they were meant for one another. <span class="small">&#7864;</span>s<span class="small">&#x0275;</span> was in a similar situation; she needed to be cared for and protected. The day she met S<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#250;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span>t<span class="small">&#224;</span> she knew he was the one. S<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#250;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#224;</span>, however, was not in any rush and waited first to have his divination carried out, and it was only when the <i>awo</i> told him that he was right in his sentiments that he went to search for <span class="small">&#7864;</span>s<span class="small">&#x0275;</span> and proposed to her. Before long, they were joined in matrimony and the bliss of love made them inseparable.</p>

<p class="indent">The verse speaks not of rushing forward in the hope of finding good things, but rather, of walking gently towards our good fortune.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> is about attracting goodness in a spirit of acceptance and wonder. Of developing a sense of mystery in relation to the world, and engaging in interested participation with it. An attitude of judgment or condemnation will restrict the natural flow of abundance towards <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>. We might say that the possibility of luck was born in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, for luck is not random, it is something that arises because we are in the right place at the right time with the necessary skills to harvest abundance. Luck is not about what we deserve, as was said in the proverb given earlier: <span class="small">&#8216;</span>If<span class="small">&#225;</span> does not recognize king or beggar<span class="small">&#8217;</span>; it is about character as an attractor of good fortune. Luck is complicated, because nothing provokes the <a id="page_305"></a>unlucky more than another<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s luck. The energy of <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> calls upon misanthropy and <i>weltschmerz</i>, not only because of the tendency of the unlucky to blame the lucky for their own misfortune, but because in <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> the misty memory of our condition as a spirit that had not experienced a human journey is present. In this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, we find the calling of the <span class="small">&#7864;</span>gb<span class="small">&#x00eb;</span> in the <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run, to remind <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> that the peace he or she seeks in the human journey is already present in the place where he or she came from. As such, <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> concerns the pain of life as much as its beauty. <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> is a warrior who goes to war with flowers and poetry as much as with curses and enchantments for devastation.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>ra</i> has much to say about how to deal with adversity, and how to sweeten one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s enemies. <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> is the natural scapegoat, because the still and fixed light becomes a stable focus for those failing in their journey. So instead of addressing the dim light within, they meet the shining light outside in a spirit of aggression and hatred. In these encounters, <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> needs to be the source of sweetness and light and avoid dimming its own brightness in response to attacks from the envious ones. I would like to paraphrase a verse from <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> in this regard. It tells how <span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span> became overwhelmed by the conspirators against him, and responded with a random attack. His attack killed a vicious person, who had dressed himself in long clothes to conceal his wickedness. At his death, Truth and Falsehood started to argue. Truth argued that he was more powerful by virtue of his knowledge and goodness than Falsehood. Falsehood countered the argument by saying he was stronger, smarter and more widespread than truth. Truth told Falsehood that he was right, that he was smart and strong and was found everywhere, but that the slow and gentle ways of truth would defeat him in the end. Falsehood agreed to this. So, indeed, conspirators and detractors are born here, but in a particular way, as failures in their own cause, their own fates, unable to discover the path of peace, joy, and contentment. Conspirators will suffer the consequences of attacking <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> as long as <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> blesses them and showers them with goodness. Repay evil with goodness, as this will bring shame on the detractors. This entire complex is illustrated in a verse in <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> that speaks of <span class="small">&#7884;</span>bal<span class="small">&#250;</span>way<span class="small">&#233;</span>, <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>d<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> and <span class="small">&#204;</span>y<span class="small">&#224;</span>m<span class="small">&#237;</span> <span class="small">&#210;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#x025A;</span>ng<span class="small">&#224;</span> coming into the world.</p>
<p class="indent">When these powers came to the world, Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span> arranged a meeting with them. He suggested to <span class="small">&#7884;</span>bal<span class="small">&#250;</span>way<span class="small">&#233;</span> that he might wish to be the custodian of money and wealth on earth, but <span class="small">&#7884;</span>bal<span class="small">&#250;</span>way<span class="small">&#233;</span> responded that he had no interest in this, rather he would like to drain the wealth of the humans and suck their <a id="page_306"></a>marrow dry. In the same way, Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span> suggested to <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> that he could be the one to ensure love between couples, but <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> replied that he would rather be the force that pulled them apart. Then Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span> suggested to <span class="small">&#204;</span>y<span class="small">&#224;</span>m<span class="small">&#237;</span> <span class="small">&#210;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#x025A;</span>ng<span class="small">&#224;</span> that she might be in charge of gestation and childbearing, but she told him that she would rather feast on the babies both inside and outside the womb. After these three forces had been presented with divine counsel but had made other decisions, Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span> called <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> and suggested that he should be in charge of blessing people with long life. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> accepted and also asked if he could receive the boons which had been rejected by the other three divinities. Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span> said, <span class="small">&#8216;</span>So be it,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> and invested <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> with the power to give long life, wealth, healthy children, love and harmony. When he came to earth <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> enjoyed all possible success and veneration, whilst his fellow <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#7865;</span>s</i> became feared and despised as they enacted what they had decreed for themselves upon the world. They also grew jealous of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> and the praise and love he reaped for his activities and soon they plotted to take him down. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>, however, had ominous dreams on the night his detractors gathered together to make plans to kill him. Upon awakening, he went to his <i>awo</i> who told him that he needed to honour his detractors, and prescribed the necessary sacrifice. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> did as he was told and went to the houses of <span class="small">&#7884;</span>bal<span class="small">&#250;</span>way<span class="small">&#233;</span>, <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> and <span class="small">&#204;</span>y<span class="small">&#224;</span>m<span class="small">&#237;</span> <span class="small">&#210;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#x025A;</span>ng<span class="small">&#224;</span>, offering up money and food. In each of their houses he paid tribute to them, saying that what he had was only possible because of them. In being attentive to his detractors, and recognizing his enemies, he managed to establish a pact of harmony and community with them. It was by showing an attitude of gratitude and humility that <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> gained the friendship of <span class="small">&#200;</span>s<span class="small">&#249;</span>. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> knew who he was, and that he was the one who held everything, but he didn<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t make any fuss about it; rather, he paid tribute to the source of his blessing.</p>
<p class="indent">No matter whether we interpret the story as one of forgiveness, fate or luck, the message is the same: if you want to embrace your own good fortune, you need to eschew bitterness and take a positive interest in your life and path. <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> is an energy that brings increase, even to the word; hence the taboo of wishing ill upon people, and of speaking ill of them. <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> is havoc and destruction veiled in the <i>kasan</i> of peace. <span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span> is pure light gestated and cultivated, veiled in whiteness, and constitutes a divine power that can be both used and misused.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> reminds us that wisdom can be found in the most unlikely places, whether a castle, tavern or at a bus stop. <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> recognizes detractors and enemies, <a id="page_307"></a>but does not judge them, because judging brings on melancholy and misanthropy. This is caused by searching hopelessly for peace and love in the world, when in fact they reside in the marrow and soul of each and every one of us. <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> is about perspective and nuance, the all-pervading and unconditional love that, like the rain, falls upon the just and unjust. So, we should accept our human journey as a shared venture and avoid judging and punishing misbehaviour. If<span class="small">&#225;</span> says that misfortune is commonly caused by a debilitated consciousness (<i>ib<span class="small">&#237;</span> or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i>) or negative patterns of behaviour rooted in one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s family (<i>ib<span class="small">&#237;</span> eg<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i>).</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> typifies the mindset of a saint, as someone who experiences the world, yet does not judge it, no matter how bothersome it might be. <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> is love, harmony and gentleness, which are the pillars of togetherness and growth that attract good fortune and abundance for us all.</p>
