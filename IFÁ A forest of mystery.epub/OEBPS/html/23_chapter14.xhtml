<p class="noindent"><a id="page_245"></a><i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> means <span class="small">&#8216;</span>run away,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> and it is also said to be the screech or cry of mysterious birds. <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> also signifies restlessness, nervousness, the flickering field of the soul and emotions. It is a dramatic <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> that tells of the merging of the visible and invisible world in Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span>, and the capacity for spirit or astral travel.</p>
<p class="indent">Here we find <span class="small">&#7884;</span>ya; and the winds are born here, be they breeze, storm, tornado or monsoon. Because of these phenomena, <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> is associated with dramatic, if not cataclysmic change. These winds are what enable the power of the word to become effective in the form of enchantments. They also have a relationship with breath itself, but in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> they have more cosmic dimensions. This wind is known as <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#224;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span>iy<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>, and refers to the winds that can result in tornados. The concept of <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i> is found here, both as a force of abundance and royalty and as something destructive and outlandish, but it is always powerful. <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> announces the arrival of the stranger, and given that <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> was himself once a stranger, this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> imparts the importance of welcoming what is strange and unfamiliar and understanding the wisdom it possesses, rather than rejecting it.</p>
<p class="indent">The dramatic and destructive qualities of this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> are detailed by Osamoro Ibie (1986), who tells us that <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span> was named Ubiquitous Wind and <span class="small">&#8216;</span>He who does what he wants and means what he does.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> The <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i> came to earth by chasing after <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span>, screaming <span class="small">&#8216;</span><i><span class="small">&#242;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span></i><span class="small">&#8217;</span> after him, and trying to devour him. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span> decided to take refuge in the forest and gather food to give to <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>y<span class="small">&#224;</span>m<span class="small">&#237;</span> <span class="small">&#210;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#x025A;</span>ng<span class="small">&#224;</span></i>, their queen. He prepared the food for them to eat so they would leave him in peace. The <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i> flocked around the offering, but as <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span> was sneaking away from the <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i>, he was spotted by them and the chase resumed. However, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span> had prepared the sacrifice close to the gate that led to Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span> and so he entered the visible world; but the <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i> came after him. He ran and ran until he found a womb he could hide within. As he jumped into the womb, awaiting the moment of gestation, he realized that he had chosen that of an <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>y<span class="small">&#224;</span>m<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> priestess. Ibie tells us that this situation was caused by <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span> neglecting to make sacrifice to <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> and <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>, which led to him being stuck at a river that marked the crossing between the worlds.</p>
<p class="indent">The river crossing is the location for another story detailing how the <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i> came to the world. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> invited the <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i> to reside within his entrails as he crossed the river, to bring them into the world. They agreed to this, but upon arriving at the other side, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> the spirits told him that they would rather stay in the moist warm comfort of his entrails and feed upon him until he died. In distress, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> sought the counsel of <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>, who told him to prepare a meal of <a id="page_246"></a>intestines and raw liver, rich with palm oil, and offer it to the <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i>. He did as <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> advised, and managed to expel them from his intestines. In this way the <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i> arrived on earth.</p>
<p class="indent">The Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span> word <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i> is associated with movement and trade. We might understand it as a marketplace of night unfolding in silver rays. This nocturnal marketplace is conceived of as a gathering of long beaked and predatory birds. The wood dove (<i>k<span class="small">&#249;</span>k<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>) also enters this marketplace to bring the blessings of wealth.</p>
<p class="indent">In the New World and the modern West, the concept of <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i> has been equated with <span class="small">&#8216;</span>witch.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> This is true, if we understand what a witch is, in African terms. <i><span class="small">&#192;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i> is considered to be a power which some people possess by inheritance, initiation or by birth. It is considered to be an excess of <i><span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> (natural power), and therefore it must be kept under control and in balance to avoid damage to its wielder and the community alike.</p>
<p class="indent">We find the word <i><span class="small">&#232;</span>n<span class="small">&#236;</span>y<span class="small">&#224;</span>n</i> being used in relation to <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i>. This term is applied to human beings, and usually defines a person who has awakened to his or her spiritual capacity. The word is also applied to one who possesses the power to cause catastrophic change, as encountered in <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span>. Such a person is known as <i><span class="small">&#x0275;</span>l<span class="small">&#x0276;</span>ye</i>, <span class="small">&#8216;</span>woman of the birds.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> They are for the most part women, although men can be adopted into these mysteries on rare occasions. If we look at the folklore connected to <i><span class="small">&#x0275;</span>l<span class="small">&#x0276;</span>ye</i>, we find a host of sinister traits, such as anthropophagism, like the ghouls. These are people born with special powers, they have an innate capacity for spirit flight, and they tend to be oracular and clairvoyant.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="small">&#192;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span> is the primordial emotional depth of womanhood. It is not a generative force, but quite the contrary. Honeysweet <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span>un represents the generative powers and fertility. <span class="small">&#192;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span>, and their mother <span class="small">&#204;</span>y<span class="small">&#224;</span>m<span class="small">&#237;</span> <span class="small">&#210;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#x025A;</span>ng<span class="small">&#224;</span>, are barrenness and otherness, femininity prior to the first blood, and the lament upon the last. <span class="small">&#192;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span> is rhizomatic, like the fungus, manifesting in peaks of power here and there, whilst its true essence is a phosphorescent network of subterranean possibilities that may or may not come into manifestation.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_248"></a>Naturally, the gift of motherhood comes with the intense field of ensouled emotional variables that take place during menstruation, gestation and the menopause. These are peak tides for the secrets of motherhood to rage and rave in its raw state. Hence, <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i> are <span class="small">&#8216;</span>birds<span class="small">&#8217;</span> that dwell, infest and feed upon our emotions and taint or heal our soul. In this lies the admonition found in numerous verses and proverbs which advise us <span class="small">&#8211;</span> and especially males <span class="small">&#8211;</span> to prostrate ourselves before <i>od<span class="small">&#250;</span></i> (the womb) and woman, pay her respect and make <i>ipese</i>, the sacrifice that calms the womb. There is a proverb that speaks of the nature of the otherness represented by women in their menopause and the powers which they acquire at this point: <span class="small">&#8216;</span>As long as a woman can generate, the womb owns her, and later, when barren, she owns her own womb.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> This means that she is no longer a woman, but <span class="small">&#8216;</span>something else,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> the powerful other.</p>
<p class="indent">It is said that <span class="small">&#204;</span>y<span class="small">&#224;</span>m<span class="small">&#237;</span> is <span class="small">&#8216;</span>seated upon Od<span class="small">&#249;</span>,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> that she crowns the feminine powers, or that <span class="small">&#210;</span>d<span class="small">&#250;</span> is an <span class="small">&#204;</span>y<span class="small">&#224;</span>m<span class="small">&#237;</span>. She is also referred to as <span class="small">&#204;</span>y<span class="small">&#224;</span>m<span class="small">&#237;</span> <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>l<span class="small">&#x0276;</span>ye, <span class="small">&#8216;</span>The owner of the birds<span class="small">&#8217;</span>; <span class="small">&#204;</span>y<span class="small">&#224;</span> <span class="small">&#192;</span>gb<span class="small">&#224;</span>, <span class="small">&#8216;</span>The elderly woman is respectable<span class="small">&#8217;</span>; and <span class="small">&#204;</span>y<span class="small">&#224;</span>m<span class="small">&#237;</span> <span class="small">&#210;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#x025A;</span>ng<span class="small">&#224;</span>, <span class="small">&#8216;</span>My mother the powerful sorceress or witch.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> This raises some controversial issues, since witchcraft is associated with antisocial acts, as well as a natural power accessible to women and members of societies such as <span class="small">&#7864;</span>gb<span class="small">&#x0276;</span> <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>l<span class="small">&#x0276;</span>ye and <span class="small">&#7864;</span>gb<span class="small">&#x0276;</span> <span class="small">&#204;</span>m<span class="small">&#249;</span>l<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>, in which the secrets of manipulating supernatural powers are preserved. Antisocial witchcraft is said to stem from <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span> bur<span class="small">&#250;</span>k<span class="small">&#250;</span></i>, but there is also another type of <span class="small">&#8216;</span>witch<span class="small">&#8217;</span> referred to as <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span> rere</i>. The difference is one of character. The word <i>bur<span class="small">&#250;</span>k<span class="small">&#250;</span></i> refers to everything that is bad, broken and corrupted. For instance the term <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span> bur<span class="small">&#250;</span>k<span class="small">&#250;</span></i> signifies a person incapable of making choices which are good for him or her, who is considered bothersome and destructive to themselves and society. On the other hand, <i>rere</i>, used interchangeably with <i><span class="small">&#237;</span>w<span class="small">&#225;</span> pele</i>, refers to a state of contentment and happiness, in which one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s character is good and one is a benevolent part of society. The Nigerian historian Lawal comments in this regard that, because women were less physically strong, they were blessed with a special form of cunning, <i><span class="small">&#7885;</span>gb<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>n ay<span class="small">&#233;</span></i>, which carries the further connotation of deceit or slyness. Still, the importance of character, and of maintaining a calm and good consciousness is stressed at all times. Even today we have proverbs amongst the Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span> referring to the influence of <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i> being like <span class="small">&#8216;</span>birds nesting in a person<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s hair.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> This is most telling because hair has the symbolic meaning of something untamed and wild, that which entangles and must be directed if a positive growth is desired. Because of this, the <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> (consciousness/the physical <a id="page_249"></a>head) is often adorned by beautifying the hair itself and fashioning it with care, as a way of appeasing and calming it.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="small">&#204;</span>y<span class="small">&#225;</span>m<span class="small">&#237;</span> is considered the ancestral progenitor of the female sex, just as <span class="small">&#210;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#242;</span> is the progenitor of the male. This would perhaps mean that while <span class="small">&#204;</span>y<span class="small">&#225;</span>m<span class="small">&#237;</span> represents supreme and transcendent womanhood, so <span class="small">&#210;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#242;</span> represents supreme and transcendent maleness. <span class="small">&#210;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#242;</span> is said to take his <i><span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> from the realm of <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>, placing this deity in the realm of transformation and change. One can understand <span class="small">&#192;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span> and <span class="small">&#210;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#242;</span> to be the same essential power, but drawn in different directions by the rhythm of creation and so becoming differentiated, as primal maleness and primal femaleness. One can see this in their cults: <span class="small">&#210;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#242;</span> is deeply related to the cult of Or<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span> Oko, the <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i> of the farm and is said to serve as a judge and middleman in cases of accusations of witchcraft. He is considered to be a calm and tranquil force, just and wise with a deep knowledge of witchcraft and sorcery.</p>
<p class="indent">The birds of <span class="small">&#204;</span>y<span class="small">&#224;</span>m<span class="small">&#237;</span> are predators, whilst the vulture is sacred to <span class="small">&#210;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#242;</span>.

<p class="indent">There is a belief in the New World that some form of enmity exists between the <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i> and If<span class="small">&#225;</span> <span class="small">&#8211;</span> but, in his capacity as the great peace maker, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> understood the necessity of such powers and how this abundance of <i><span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> can benefit mankind. This mystery is guarded in the society of <span class="small">&#7884;</span>gb<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>ni, where the traditional dynamic of power between the left and right hands is understood and used. Further, the weight and quality of colours is also preserved here, because the potential for all manifestation comes in the colours of red, black and white, which are degrees of mercy, coldness and fire.</p>

<p class="indent">The <i><span class="small">&#7885;</span><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#x0273;</span></i> tree (<i>Drypetes sp</i>.), also known as <i><span class="small">&#x025A;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>, is a source of success here, and we find this name as an alias for plants like <i><span class="small">&#7885;</span>r<span class="small">&#x0273;</span></i> (<i>Nesgordonia papaverifera</i>) and <i>ay<span class="small">&#232;</span></i> (<i>Sterculia rhinopetala</i>). All of these are said to initiate cycles of success, even though they grow at a slow pace. Traditionally, veneration is made to these plants by giving up some of one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s body hair to them, especially from the armpit and pubic region. This giving up of hair represents a renouncement of wickedness. We find toxic and hallucinogenic plants here, as well as strange and unusual, i.e. carnivorous, ones. Daturas and lilies have their place in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. These are all plants that challenge us to approach them in a spirit of understanding; <a id="page_251"></a>reckless use of them can bring insanity or death, though in truth they possess a unique wisdom.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> provides several stories about the kind of trouble and turmoil the <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>y<span class="small">&#224;</span>m<span class="small">&#237;</span>s</i> or Elders of the Night can cause. One of these speaks of how Il<span class="small">&#233;</span> If<span class="small">&#x0275;</span> was haunted by all sorts of problems. People became both poor and barren for apparently no reason, veiling the city in unhappiness. The citizens of Il<span class="small">&#233;</span> If<span class="small">&#x0275;</span> called upon Eg<span class="small">&#250;</span>ng<span class="small">&#250;</span>n to come to their aid, after all, he was the straightener and held the wisdom of ancestry. Eg<span class="small">&#250;</span>ng<span class="small">&#250;</span>n came to earth and, as he was about to start the work of sorting out the problems of the people, the <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span>s</i> flocked around him and attacked him. He sank to the ground and declared that his mission had failed. Realizing that Eg<span class="small">&#250;</span>ng<span class="small">&#250;</span>n had been defeated, the people called upon <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n to help them. <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n heard their call and went to an <i>awo</i> for divination. The <i>awo</i> told <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n that the situation was very delicate, and that he would be defeated unless he made the necessary sacrifices, one of which was to feed the <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i>. <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n saw no reason to feed the Elders of the Night and went to earth; only to be defeated in the same manner as Eg<span class="small">&#250;</span>ng<span class="small">&#250;</span>n. Seeing the defeat of <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n, the elders of the city called upon <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> for help. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> went to an <i>awo</i> for divination, and was told that he needed to feed the <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i> and his If<span class="small">&#225;</span> before dealing with the problems in Il<span class="small">&#233;</span> If<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> did as the <i>awo</i> advised and went to earth and managed to sort out the situation through his prowess in establishing pacts, limits and agreements between the Elders of the Night and the citizens.</p>
<p class="indent">This story is related to the importance of hospitality in <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>, and the need to avoid judging people based on their appearance and social position. Il<span class="small">&#233;</span> If<span class="small">&#x0275;</span> suffered because the citizens were not interested in appeasing hostile forces nor in recognizing the embodiments of radical <i><span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> represented by the Elders of the Night.</p>
<p class="indent">These spiritual forces are more hot and intense than any others, therefore it is important to understand how to relate to them in ways that release the milk of mothers and the fertility of the womb; rather than causing catastrophe by mistreating or ignoring powers that can harm as much as bless.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_253"></a><i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> warns against being ruled by passion and allowing arrogance and hubris to develop. In relation to the latter we find the story of the <i><span class="small">&#x025A;</span>s<span class="small">&#236;</span>n</i> (cormorant). <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> speaks of a time when the birds came together to elect a leader, who had to be chosen on the basis of the traits he possessed; courage, intelligence and elegance were deemed especially desirable. After debating the election for a long time, they finally decided that <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#236;</span>n was best suited to be their leader. When this declaration was made, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#236;</span>n rose to the challenge but it didn<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t take long before his head became swollen with pride. In his self glorification, he started to issue laws and commandments, such as proclaiming that his tree was for his use alone, and that no bird was allowed to rest there unless duly invited. He also declared that no one should ever challenge his pronouncements, because he was after all, the most intelligent of all birds, so how could anyone possibly add anything to whatever he decided? After this, he started to issue impossible and tyrannical taboos of food and dress, and became intensely rigid in his commands. Naturally this stirred unrest amongst the birds, and before long a conspiracy started to form. The conspirators decided to cover his tree in gum arabic so that he would become stuck there and die from starvation and neglect. However, on the very night when the conspirators decided to act out their plan, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#236;</span>n was plagued by nightmares and ill omens and at the break of dawn he flew to the house of his <i>awo</i> to consult with If<span class="small">&#225;</span>. His <i>awo</i> told him that he had offended all the birds with his behaviour and that only a change of attitude and a demonstration of humility could solve his problem. His <i>awo</i> told him to give sacrifice to the <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span>s</i>. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#236;</span>n immediately made the sacrifice, and called the birds to a conclave in a grove in the forest. Here he humbled his pride and asked forgiveness for his behaviour, declaring that all his laws were no longer to be observed. Seeing that <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#236;</span>n genuinely repented, the birds responsible for the conspiracy came forward and forgave him. The others followed suit. They warned him not to go to his tree, because it was coated with glue, and advised him to take up residence in the <i>iy<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> tree along with the rest of them instead. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#236;</span>n agreed, and declared that the birds needed a council to discuss the matters that affected them, and from that day he demonstrated the qualities he was elected for and reaped respect. It is from this story that we have the If<span class="small">&#225;</span> proverb: <span class="small">&#8216;</span>Hard green bananas will eventually become sweet and soft.<span class="small">&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="indent">Pride is one negative ray in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> and another is the excess of passion and the justification that comes with it. We find this theme expounded on in a story <a id="page_254"></a>in which <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> takes a lover, which goes like this: <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>p<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>h<span class="small">&#x0276;</span>, the seventh child of the leader of the witches, was spoiled by his mother and they were very close to each another. This was because he was the consequence of the great sacrifice she had made in giving up the other six children that came before him. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>p<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>h<span class="small">&#x0276;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s mother was very influential, and ensured that her son lived in fine conditions, and arranged a marriage for him with a wonderful and beautiful woman. As mentioned, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>p<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>h<span class="small">&#630;</span> was very close to his mother and he spent more time with her than with his wife. Time passed and <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>p<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>h<span class="small">&#630;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s wife became increasingly sad, lonely and isolated. She started to go out more, following the advice of one of her friends. And so she went in ever greater frequency to the market and to visit friends and relatives. Before long, she met <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> in the market and it was love at first sight. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> was married to Yem<span class="small">&#242;</span><span class="small">&#243;</span> himself, but that relationship was not going well, so he found himself in the same situation as <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>p<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>h<span class="small">&#630;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s wife. Hence they allowed love to develop between them and as their passions became stirred, they grew more and more careless and greedy in their infatuation with each other, until their desire became so strong that they decided to move in together. Before doing so, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> went to his <i>awo</i> for divination. His <i>awo</i> told him that he was about to take something that was not his, and that even if it was easy enough to take, holding on to it would cause tremendous problems. He was advised to make sacrifice to save his life and to give up on the project, but in his lovelorn state he was incapable of giving up <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>p<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>h<span class="small">&#630;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s wife, although he did offer the sacrifice. The lovers moved in together in a hidden place, but when his wife did not show up that night or the morning after, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>p<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>h<span class="small">&#630;</span> became worried and started to search for her. After two days, he met Yem<span class="small">&#242;</span><span class="small">&#243;</span>, who had been left by <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span>, and she told him where his wife was. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>p<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>h<span class="small">&#630;</span> went straight to his mother and reported the disgrace and it didn<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t take long before all the witches knew that <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> was in big trouble. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>p<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>h<span class="small">&#630;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s mother, however, refused to do anything or to comment on the case, and this made the other witches weary and upset. They called a secret meeting and there they decided to destroy <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> and his house. They declared that anyone who tried to help him would also be destroyed and so they set out to tear <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> to pieces and feed upon him. As the witches arrived at the house where <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> and his lover had hidden themselves, they started to chant and sing curses upon him. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> looked out from the window and saw the witches flocking, and decided it was time to flee. He took his silver cutlass and his lover with him, and ran to the house of <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> for help and protection. But as they entered the house of <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span>, the witches were already too close and so all three had to run. And in this way they ran from house to house, <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i> to <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i>, until they came to the house of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> was awake when they arrived, as terrible nightmares had disturbed his sleep since the <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span>s</i> approached <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> for the first time that night. In order to expel the bad dreams, he had put out food for the <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span>s</i> covered with gum arabic, as instructed in his dreams. As <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> and his lover came to his house along with a host of <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>s</i>, and with the <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span>s</i> in pursuit of them, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> realized the meaning of his dreams, and told <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> and his lover and all the <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>s</i> to enter his house and to rest assured that nothing ill would come to pass. The <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span>s</i> flocked around, screeching, cursing and chanting. All this convulsion and noise caught the attention of <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>, who came to the house of his friend <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>. <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> immediately understood what was happening and went to the <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span>s</i> and greeted them. They greeted him back and <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> told them that <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> had prepared food for them, and suggested that they take their fill before the fight, so they could rip apart the <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>s</i> with full force. The <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span>s</i> laughed and took delight in the fact that <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> would feed his enemies before being ripped apart by them, and so they descended upon the food and became stuck in the glue. Seeing that the witches were trapped, <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> knocked on the door of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> s house and told him that the <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span>s</i> were stuck in the sacrifice and that he should come out and take care of the situation. In gratitude, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> gave <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> his treasured cutlass and he went out and beheaded all the <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span>s</i>. He came back in and announced the victory and <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> gave him his cutlass as a gift. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> had used the <i>iy<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> tree (<i>Daniellia oliveri</i>), which came to earth in <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>nd<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>, and its gum, to attract and bind the <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i>.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_257"></a>The story uses <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> as an example to illustrate the gravity of hubris, that when it comes to passions, even the spirit of purity can succumb to temptation and err. Knowing that such forces exist in creation should inspire a certain modesty and care in how we conduct ourselves in the world. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span> carries the message that it is not the fault of <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i> that we attract them, they are simply acting in accord with their nature, rather, it is we who attract them through our acts and choices. This message also imparts a piece of advice, that borders upon taboo, namely never to blame a woman for one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s misfortune. This is because all women have a natural connection to these forces, and a constant practice of sacrifice that will appease <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i> is performed by treating women well.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_258"></a>A tale of <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n and his marriage to M<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>b<span class="small">&#243;</span>w<span class="small">&#250;</span> gives an example of how accusing one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s wife of being the source of misfortune leads to disaster. The story tells how they were both struggling to make ends meet before their marriage, and how this situation became even worse after they were wed. <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n experienced diminishing success in his hunting, and could find no buyers for the products of his forge. He grew increasingly frustrated with the situation, and came to believe that it was his wife who was the source of his misfortune. His wife experienced an equal lack of success in her trade and she similarly blamed <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n. She began to remember her other suitors and, in recalling them and envisioning how successful she could have been with any of them, she began to hate <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n. One day M<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>b<span class="small">&#243;</span>w<span class="small">&#250;</span> reached the end of her patience and started to harass, hit and finally scar <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n with a nail, to which he responded by beating her up. She decided to leave him, but first went to an <i>awo</i> for a divination. The <i>awo</i> told her that it was not good to leave her husband, and that she was so preoccupied with money that none could enter her life. The <i>awo</i> pointed out that she was blessed with all other good fortune but that the good fortune of money would only come if she and her husband were to treat each other with love and pay attention to their relationship. Only this would attract the good fortune of money. She was advised to give sacrifice to the Elders of the Night, which she made without delay, and decided to give the relationship another chance. <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n followed suit and in their togetherness they slowly created a path for abundance to come to them. In a short time their relationship grew in love, harmony and wealth.
