<p class="chaptitle"><a id="page_104"></a>&#593;e cosmology of If&#225;</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_105"></a>The cosmology expounded in If<span class="small">&#225;</span> is cyclical. Further, If<span class="small">&#225;</span> invites comparison with Pythagorean ideas, viewing Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span> or earth as a body surrounding a central fire. If we go deeper into the metaphysics of If<span class="small">&#225;</span> we find geocentric and heliocentric, Ptolemaic and Copernican similarities, and even ideas similar to Al-Razi<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s theories of the multiverse. While Boethius, Plotinus and Bruno have been mentioned as references for understanding If<span class="small">&#225;</span> cosmology, we can loosely define If<span class="small">&#225;</span> as a noetic consensus reality, and thus essentially a timeless philosophy.</p>
<p class="indent">Metaphysically speaking, If<span class="small">&#225;</span> sees the invisible and visible realms as categories in constant interaction. Any number of worlds or realms can meet and interact, and our own, Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span>, is one of many possible worlds. Just like any other world, Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span> is endowed with a divine immutable spirit which gives it life and a unique form, rhythm and perfection. Every planet and every stellar body in our universe is inhabited by a spirit with a particular consciousness. In the case of Venus it is a spirit called <span class="small">&#192;</span>guala; the Sun is inhabited by the spirit called <span class="small">&#192;</span>m<span class="small">&#x025A;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span>; and Sirius (the canoe star) is the dwelling of the spirit <span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span>w<span class="small">&#x0273;</span> Al<span class="small">&#x0276;</span>. These ideas are not far from those which we find in Leibniz<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s theory of the Monads.</p>
<p class="indent">If<span class="small">&#225;</span> holds that the beginning of everything is rooted in the presence of a mysterious light that began to move and, as it contracted and expanded, generated a variety of light forms. All of the rays that rose from the explosions caused by the pulse of light became conscious of its ray as their source. Hence the beginning of everything was an explosion of light. The director of the explosion was the intelligence inhabited by the primordial mysterious light, which we call Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span>, a name which in its fullness means <span class="small">&#8216;</span>owner of the rainbow snakes that rose from the womb,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> but who is usually referred to as <span class="small">&#8216;</span>the owner of heaven.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> If we pursue the symbolism of serpents rising from a womb, we find that snakes represent primordial rays of being rising from the <i>igb<span class="small">&#225;</span>m<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>l<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i>, <span class="small">&#8216;</span>the calabash of light.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> This can be seen in the creator spirit <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> who has the python (<i>er<span class="small">&#232;</span></i>) as one of his attributes; the python is associated with the rainbow (Bascom 1969: 267).</p>
<p class="indent">There is no hierarchy of value as such in If<span class="small">&#225;</span>, as the hierarchy of beings is dictated by placement and action. The social order is regulated by the chief of a village, city or nation, but If<span class="small">&#225;</span> is also concerned with mastery over situations and skills. For instance, if a king seeks to learn the art of forging metal he needs to approach <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n, but not as king, rather, as a student of metallurgy. While the blacksmith naturally gives due respect to the o<span class="small">&#64259;</span>ce of the king, the king must also recognize that, when in the hall of the blacksmith, he is not the master of <a id="page_106"></a>the art he is being mentored in. If we are forging a knife, the one who knows best how to accomplish this task should be the one in charge, no matter what his social status. This sensitivity to role and domain, skill and wisdom, flows abundantly through If<span class="small">&#225;</span>, and these roles are not only assigned to human organization, but also in relation to plants and animals. For instance, a hunter seeking prey in the forest is not necessarily the master of the domain he is entering. However, the trees and plants in this domain can function as his teachers and allies.</p>
<p class="indent">In Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span> societies, especially in the countryside, the exchanges between roles in a hierarchical dynamic occurs easily and naturally. This is because of the insistence upon building good character in If<span class="small">&#225;</span>. Alongside this is the recognition of what is being done, and the necessity of attuning yourself to the act performed. This attitude is possible because good character, awareness and gentleness are virtues of such enormous importance in traditional Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span> society.</p>
<p class="indent">There is a hierarchy involved in If<span class="small">&#225;</span> and its cosmology, but this hierarchy is one of natural emanation and the proper assignment of a power for a given task. For instance, when <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> was sent to earth to make dry land he was not chosen because he was more important, but because he was the embodiment of consciousness and thoughtfulness. His recognition as the most important <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i> came about because of his character, which all beings in creation recognized. His prestige was the result of him demonstrating his worth through challenges and the way in which he resolved complicated situations.</p>
<p class="h3">a golden chain</p>
<p class="indent">If<span class="small">&#225;</span> tells of how spiritual beings descended a chain to make the earth habitable for humans. There are some variations of this story, but most commonly they relate how <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> came down to Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span> on a chain of gold (or iron) forged by <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n. He carries a bag of earth with him and a guinea hen that then scatters the earth over the waters. This act announces the arrival of spiritual forces in great quantity on earth. These first powers that came to earth were the spirits called <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#7865;</span></i>, spirits from the calabash of light. Together with these came also <i>ajog<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i>, <span class="small">&#8216;</span>strong ones who cause misfortune.<span class="small">&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="indent">In the corpus of If<span class="small">&#225;</span> we find some variation in the amount of spirits that came to Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span>, but the most prevalent ones tell of 200 on the left side and 201 on the <a id="page_107"></a>right side, or 400 on the left and 401 on the right. <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n is the force of light that caused the <i>ajog<span class="small">&#250;</span>ns</i> to arrive on earth, hence the slight imbalance in numbers that is necessary for movement.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> represent the spiritual blueprint of forms in the world. Infinite and mysterious, they might be described as the various forms of the godhead which we recognize in spirits, plants, animals, <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>s</i> and humans. These active potencies of conscious light ignite consciousness in all things. In their capacity as rays of light, like rainbows, they are also spirits whose inclination is one of communication.</p>
<p class="indent">It is amongst these 401 travelling <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> that we find the manifestation of <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i> and the ensoulment of every plant, beast and mineral. These travelling <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> can take any shape they desire; it is these beings that are <span class="small">&#8216;</span>gods that walk amongst men.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> They are never what they present themselves as, rather, they represent vibrations, forces and energies that ensoul all things and bring consciousness to situations, conditions and memory. These <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> relate to specific elements or vibrations, but we cannot say that they are these things, any more than we can say that the spirit of <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n is iron, even though iron is experienced as <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n because it is ensouled with his qualities. In the same way, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span>un is sensed through sweet waters, rivers, and waterfalls, but she is not that which she appears within.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> always enter and leave the world in mysterious ways, hence we find the many conflicting stories of <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i>. Some speak of particular <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> walking amongst men, and others are stories of remarkable men and women who expressed a given vibration in a specific situation in such a way that the expression of this particular light led to a perfection, namely <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i>.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#210;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i> is therefore a complex concept, because an <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> <span class="small">&#8216;</span>walking as a god amongst men,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> will be recognized as <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i>, but a human being under the influence of a given <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> who lives his or her life in concord with fate and its natural vibration will through deed, death and memory become <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i> in turn. This means that the dead (<i>eg<span class="small">&#250;</span>ng<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i>) are often the foundation from which <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>s</i> arise. <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i> are a shard of consciousness, forces of nature that have become exemplary either as men performing remarkable feats or as gods walking amongst humans. This is the field of Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span>, in which gods become men and men become gods. It is here that the visible and invisible worlds blend and melt in conformity with our perception and saturate the world with wisdom and potentiality.</p>
<p class="h3"><a id="page_108"></a>the wisdom of the worlds</p>
<p class="indent">In his teachings, Baba Medahochi presented diagrams, which I will provide in a somewhat modified (and elaborated) form. Figure 1 shows the closed calabash of existence and how everything, visible and invisible, is connected.</p>
<p class="indent">When the calabash of existence is opened, there is a different cosmic rhythm, in which the calabash is as a still point which allows a flow of light and energy everywhere. The opened calabash releases forces of <span class="small">&#8216;</span>night<span class="small">&#8217;</span> and of <span class="small">&#8216;</span>day,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> forces that challenge us to develop good character and cultivate those forces which exemplify it. An illustration of our world within the worlds and the composition of forces we are subject to would look like figure 2.</p>
<p class="indent">These show that the visible and invisible world comprise a harmonious unit in which the spirit of <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> permeates all of creation, on all levels and on all planes. Everything in the world is infused with the spirit of wisdom. They reveal the tremendous potential we have in Il<span class="small">&#233;</span> Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span>, our earth, to become subject to wisdoms of all forms, in many shades and frequencies of light. Our world would then look like figure 3.</p>

<p class="indent">Some comment is needed before we embark upon the second part of the book, which will present the sixteen <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> pairs and one more; the <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> assigned to <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>, <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>. <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> was the <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> revealed to <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> when <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> and <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> became companions. As such the birth of <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>, which occurs in <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>, will be used as a basis for a summary of the presentation of the sixteen <i>m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span> od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. In this I have striven towards giving a comprehensive sense of the complexity of these original forces of creation. This involves a fair amount of storytelling, which provides multiple reference points for the poetic wisdom of the verses. I have approached this matter as an <i>awo</i> attempting to lay down the fundamental energies of creation, and in doing so I have made no distinction between ensouled beings, whether they are spirit, plant, animal or human. This means that in the presentation of <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> you will find sages going to trees and animals for divination and you will find the lives and deeds of plants and beasts presented side by side with those of humans.</p>

<p class="img_center"><i>figure 3</i></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_110"></a>I have deliberately avoided a stringent order in my presentation, because an <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> is a complex concentration of diverse manifestation from a given vibration. Just as we in our human journey need to experience the totality of a vibration to define it, I have endeavored to do the same, to display the many facets connected to a particular ray of light or vibration.</p>
<p class="indent">The sixteen <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span>s</i> are a cycle, from the beginning of light in <i><span class="small">&#200;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span> Ogb<span class="small">&#232;</span></i> until its cosmic inhalation in <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i>. The sixteen pairs demonstrate how powers came into the world, and how all that is ensouled is mirrored in one of these sixteen <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span>s</i>. The cycle also speaks of the development of communities, whether cities or kingdoms. Birth, death and rebirth are encoded throughout creation: everything that happens and everything that exists is ultimately rooted in an <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. Each pair of <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> possess a consciousness and hands, one marked with the sun and the other with the moon. Each vibration can protect or withhold, just as it can give and bless. But we would do well to remember that the blessing of a snake might be in its venom.</p>
<p class="indent">In all its stories, verses, proverbs, songs, prayers and enchantments, If<span class="small">&#225;</span> calls our attention to what we all share in common. If<span class="small">&#225;</span> presents the wisdom of the world in such a way that we can understand the origin of a given act, energy, word or situation, leaving no room for misapprehension and resentment.This discernment is fundamental to a deep understanding of If<span class="small">&#225;</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">If<span class="small">&#225;</span> insists that we are all born unique, that we carry a distinct quality that can nevertheless be identified as coming from a clearly defined ray of light. If we have su<span class="small">&#64259;</span>cient wisdom we will naturally transform this into benevolence, if we lack wisdom we will engage in errors of judgment and establish a negative pattern. There is a question at the root of philosophical enquiry, namely: what is real? If<span class="small">&#225;</span> is a classical philosophy, and like any good philosophy it does not answer the question, but only points the way, and sends vibrations that enable a realization of what is good and true. The world is good, it is perfect. If we don<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t see the perfection in the design we perhaps lack perspective. The increase in perspective is what the presentation of the wisdom found in the sixteen <i>m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span> od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> that follow in the second part will provide.</p>
