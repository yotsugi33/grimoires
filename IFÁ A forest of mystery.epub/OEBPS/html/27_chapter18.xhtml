<p class="noindent"><a id="page_309"></a><i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#7865;</span>t<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i> signifies forcing, dominating or conquering good fortune. It speaks of us as the authors of our fate, just as it speaks of the presence of adversity that inspires us to develop good character. Good character is not something that miraculously happens just because we want it, it is a constant practice, and naturally we will be confronted with difficulties and trials.</p>
<p class="indent">It is here that we find the true purpose of <i>ajog<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i>. These spirits that bring death, misery and poverty, are here to show us <span class="small">&#8216;</span>the other way,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> so that we can make the better choice. <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#7865;</span>t<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i> tells us that these spirits are owned by <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>, yet they entered into the world by means of the roads which <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n opened between the invisible and visible realm. <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#7865;</span>t<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i> speaks in this context about the use of the drums to call upon all kinds of forces, summoning spirits of destruction as much as constructive and benign ones.</p>
<p class="indent">A story tells of an <i>awo</i> called Ol<span class="small">&#249;</span>k<span class="small">&#243;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>n who went to the city of Ot<span class="small">&#250;</span>n (righteousness) to expel the <i>ajog<span class="small">&#250;</span>ns</i> with <i><span class="small">&#7885;</span>f<span class="small">&#x025A;</span> <span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> (enchantments) and If<span class="small">&#225;</span> medicine. The citizens were told to cease using the drums for three years so they would not attract death to their dwelling places. This verse is related to the City of Vice (Ode Ote) where the people had no peace or health. If<span class="small">&#225;</span> went to this city, and told them to practice the sacrifice of <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>, meaning the practice of love, and the absence of vengeance and wickedness.</p>
<p class="indent">The adverse reflection of <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> is transformed in <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#7865;</span>t<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i> through situations in which it provides the answer to the complications experienced. These themes are expanded upon in the following verse:</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">This verse is found in the story telling of the city of Vice. The inhabitants of the city were utterly selfish and indulged in whatever debauchery appealed to them. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> arrived in the city and realized that hedonism and gluttony were responsible for the people attracting misfortune. He used two parables to illustrate what was going on. In the first, he spoke of the sand on the road to Ij<span class="small">&#232;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>, a city some 30 km west of Il<span class="small">&#233;</span> If<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>, a reference to the road and journey being the same for each of us, but by the same means given to all, some of us learn to move gracefully, while others walk in the world as best they can.</p>
<p class="indent">The other element in this verse, his marriage with M<span class="small">&#7885;</span>ran<span class="small">&#237;</span>n, the daughter of the sweetness hidden in the forest, tells of valuing others and especially those we meet in love. The reference to <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> decorating his intimate parts with red coral is a reference to the abundance that lies in finding one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s soulmate, and also to respect, if not revere, one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s partner and be aware of the nature of the bond of love. In other words, he is bringing in the forces of <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> to combat the tendency of <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#7865;</span>t<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i> to attract <i>ajog<span class="small">&#250;</span>ns</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, the verse speaks about how every If<span class="small">&#225;</span> initiate becomes <i>iyawo</i>, the bride or wife of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>. The verse illustrates the respect, love and care he holds for each and every one of his wives as an example we should live by.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#7865;</span>t<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i> is concerned with resisting the temptation of selfishness, because <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#7865;</span>t<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i>, being the good fortune we worked to manifest, comes as a result of hard work. It is a product of effort, and something we tend to guard and save, but If<span class="small">&#225;</span> is as adamant in stating that sharing is the formula for increase as it is in emphasizing the counsel in <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> about not bragging about one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s good fortune. The greatest vice in <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#7865;</span>t<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i> is selfishness, and self-serving people restrict goodness. One If<span class="small">&#225;</span> proverb says: <span class="small">&#8216;</span>An elder who eats his food in disregard of others will carry a burden to his home,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> and the <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> tells us that such a person should not be helped when his greed undoes him. He needs to realize the need for help before we offer our assistance. It is a warning against gluttony in all its forms, for it will alienate the selfish one from true friendship and community.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#7865;</span>t<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i> is rooted in a conflict between what is known and unknown, which leads to restricting goodness by jealously guarding one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s achievements. This temperament <a id="page_312"></a>can give way to gluttony and selfishness, the will to dominate, and unbridled worldly ambition. In this field rebellion is born as a consequence of learning to walk the world and understand its quarters and rhythm. Some walk gently to the rhythm of creation, whilst others march steadfastly to the beat of their own drum.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#7865;</span>t<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i> is about walking towards good fortune as much as it is about the missteps and failures that occur on the path of life. It is concerned with wrong choices and false friends. It is about taking over the world and being out of sync with it. This means that in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> we find the ability to adapt to harsh conditions and the reminder that the secret of prosperity is about seizing every new day as an opportunity. In this respect, the opportunist and the wayfarer are the same, they make their fortune upon the same sand which they walk upon. It is an <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> that speaks of temptation <span class="small">&#8211;</span> and temptation is what <i>ajog<span class="small">&#250;</span>ns</i> are. No doubt it is the ownership of these forces that gained <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> his diabolical reputation.</p>
<p class="indent">There is no devil in If<span class="small">&#225;</span>, however. It is important not to preceive the devil as a force outside yourself. <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> and the <i>ajog<span class="small">&#250;</span>ns</i> are not your enemies, even though they confront you exactly as though this is what they are. These spirits bestow misery, death and obstruction because it is their nature to do so. The gift of <i>ajog<span class="small">&#250;</span>ns</i> is only bestowed if we give in to their temptation. The temptation lies in each and every situation that offers an opportunity to develop good character. In every challenge, in every friction and misunderstanding, in every choice, these spiritual forces wait close by, ready to be invited in, and they celebrate every moment in which they are not invited, knowing that the temptation they represented was resisted. We need to understand these spirits, not as a demon host that desires death, confusion and misery. They do bring these things, but they want us to deny their gifts. In this way they hold the power of <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#7865;</span>t<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i>, through being spirits that wish to retain what they have and not share it.</p>
<p class="indent">As we know from our human realm, people who possess riches, love and abundance can, at times, speak too much of their good fortune, and this generates a field of temptation giving rise to feelings of envy, regret and hatred in us. It is in these emotional communications that we call upon <i>ajog<span class="small">&#250;</span>ns</i> as our very own challengers. We might say that <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#7865;</span>t<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i> has a natural tendency to attract the negative vibration of good things in its hunt for good fortune, in the form of temptation and negative emotions.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_315"></a><i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#7865;</span>t<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i> has much to say about carrying burdens. Not only those which the selfish person takes home by denying help to others when difficulties arise, it is also about taking on the burden of the world, and doing what is good and right no matter what the reward or repercussion.</p>
<p class="indent">This is illustrated by <i>ig<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i>, the vulture, who offered to bring the sacrifices of humans to Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span>. One story tells how the earth was about to be destroyed and Ig<span class="small">&#250;</span>n had to take an urgent message to Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span> in order to stop the planned annihilation. He dutifully went to <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run using every shortcut imaginable and averted the destruction of Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span>. He returned to earth expecting praise and reward but, contrary to his expectation, nobody took any notice of him, nor did they gave him any credit for saving the world; they merely commented on how ugly and filthy he was with his bald head and black wings, a head that has become bald after carrying <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span></i> to <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run and feathers that had become black from being exposed to intense light and heat.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two other stories that illustrate these matters well, the first was told to me by Chief Ad<span class="small">&#233;</span>wuy<span class="small">&#236;</span>. A farming couple called Oniyagbe and Omojinkun inherited a good piece of land which they started to cultivate. The harvest was good, actually better than good. They rejoiced in their success, but their happiness was overshadowed by Omojinkun<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s infertility. No matter how much they tried to have children, it was to no avail. They decided to focus on farming, and grew in abundance, until one day a couple of monkeys invaded their plantation and started to destroy the fruit of their labours. Oniyagbe decided to go to his <i>awo</i> for divination, and his <i>awo</i> told him that the monkeys had also been coming to him for divination, and that these events were truly related. The <i>awo</i> advised Oniyagbe to make a sacrifice and then to hide himself under cover of the trees of his plantation, because he would surely witness something mysterious. Oniyagbe went to the plantation as the night fell, and before long he saw a male monkey appear, eating carefully of the corn he had planted while he sang:</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent"><i>The owner of the farm should not die</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>And the tree of <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#249;</span>nb<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>r<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i> (<i>Leucaena leucocephala</i>)<i>should not fall</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>By this time next year</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>I shall be able to dance</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>Gbantete gbantete</i> (<i>the rhythmic sound of the drum</i>)</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_316"></a>Oniyagbe was not only perplexed by what he witnessed, but also happy to hear that the monkey was actually a protector of his life and fortune. As the song fell silent, he saw a female monkey arrive and she greedily ate whatever she wanted, carelessly singing:</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent"><i>If the owner of the farm could die</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>Let him die</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>If the tree of <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#249;</span>nb<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>r<span class="small">&#x0275;</span> could fall</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>Let it be</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>By this time next year</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>We shall look for another farm to eat and harvest</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>We shall also seek another tree to stand on</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>Gbantete, gbantete</i></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">When Oniyagbe heard the curse of the female monkey he took out his revolver and shot her. He brought the monkey home to prepare for food, but as he cut her open, he witnessed yet another mystery: the white beads of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> (which are called <i><span class="small">&#7779;</span>e<span class="small">&#7779;</span>efun</i>) were in her womb. He took the <i><span class="small">&#7779;</span>e<span class="small">&#7779;</span>efun</i> to his <i>awo</i>, who told him that his wife would indeed become pregnant, and instructed him in a procedure involving the <i><span class="small">&#7779;</span>e<span class="small">&#7779;</span>efun</i> to ensure the fertility of her womb. Just as the <i>awo</i> had predicted, Omojinkun became pregnant and a male child was born to the couple.</p>
<p class="indent">This story speaks of the importance of carrying good words and good thoughts in our minds and mouths because they attract goodness, whilst the curses uttered by the female monkey brought about the end of her life.</p>
<p class="indent">The other version of this story tells of how Oniyagbe responded to monkeys invading the plantation by killing them and chasing them away. But this only made matters worse, as the monkeys became more and more furious at him, and called more of their kind to carry out even greater destruction. With his plantation in ruins, Oniyagbe went to his <i>awo</i> for a divination. His <i>awo</i> told him that he would only achieve peace and fortune by speaking with the monkeys and giving over some of his plantation to them. With some reluctance he did as the <i>awo</i> advised and struck a deal with the monkeys, he would plant food for them in return for peace and protection. Thus he gained good harvests, protection and wisdom.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_317"></a>There is also the story about <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span>un, who is symbolized by the <i>ig<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i> or vulture. This story is a continuation of the one which tells of how Ig<span class="small">&#250;</span>n reaped ingratitude after saving the world from destruction. It tells of how the vulture decided to stay and continue his duty, despite people<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s ingratitude for his unselfish work, because he realized that he was not the servant of humans, but of Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span>. If Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span> decided that people needed the vulture<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s assistance he would continue to offer it. The story tells of a time of turbulence and misfortune in Il<span class="small">&#233;</span> If<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span>un spoke strongly about the reason for the problems in the city, saying that they were caused by people failing to show the necessary respect and regard for women. Her fervent insistence on this matter generated enmity and it didn<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t take long before people began to accuse her of being the cause of misfortune, especially of the illness of their children and the lack of fertility in the city.</p>
<p class="indent">When the day of confrontation came, she denied their accusations, and asked for her husband <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> to come and reason with them, but they accused him of supporting his wife in a biased way and decided that they should both be banished from the city. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> was disappointed with this outcome and went to one of his students for a divination. His student told him that everything would be fine, they would be justified and the culprits would be exposed. He told <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> to make sacrifice to <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> and to the <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>y<span class="small">&#224;</span>m<span class="small">&#237;</span>s</i>. He did as he was told, and that very same night <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> went to the gathering of the <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>y<span class="small">&#224;</span>m<span class="small">&#237;</span>s</i>, telling them how much he hated <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span>un and how much he wanted her dead.</p>
<p class="indent">The <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>y<span class="small">&#224;</span>m<span class="small">&#237;</span>s</i> were very happy to hear this, because <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span>un had been a constant obstacle to their plan of killing off the children in the city. <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> stirred them up and spread confusion and bickering amongst them; they became loud in their accusations against one another, which drew the attention of people living nearby to where they had gathered. <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> left the gathering while the <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>y<span class="small">&#224;</span>m<span class="small">&#237;</span>s</i> were fighting amongst themselves, and called the attention of the people who had come to that place, and helped them realize the true source of the city<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s misfortune. And so it happened that the true culprits were exposed and the one wrongly accused was vindicated. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span>un however refused to return to the city and said that if they needed what she had to offer, they would have to use the plant <i><span class="small">&#x025A;</span>d<span class="small">&#250;</span>nd<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i> (<i>Kalanchoe crenata</i>) in her place.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#7865;</span>t<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i> has the capacity to attract the negative vibration of good things, and it sets us the challenge of holding on to fate and what is right. Through it, we learn to see adversity and negativity as teachers and guides. It is here that we find <a id="page_318"></a>such proverbs as: <span class="small">&#8216;</span>It is when the tree is young that we should prune its branches,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> and: <span class="small">&#8216;</span>If the tree is huge and tall, and we seek the top leaves, we should cut it down from the root,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> which reminds us to end negativity before it grows out of proportion, and that at some point wickedness will fall. This means that <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#7865;</span>t<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i> is an <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> that promises a life free from trouble and chaos so long as we are familiar with these forces.</p>
<p class="indent">The <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span>s</i> spread out into the world here, which is in harmony with this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> being that of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>nil<span class="small">&#233;</span>, the spirit of Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span>, our world. In this way we can comprehend our world as a marketplace where we make our fortune in relation to our understanding of what we attract into our lives.</p>
<p class="indent">The swamp and marshes were born here. The swamp represents disease and illness, and it also represents the hopeless condition of being swallowed by the world and negativity, which happens if we allow depression to rule us. In these instances we need to look at the frogs and toads and how they make clever use of an unfriendly environment, turning the swamp into a comfortable home. It is tempting to state that if you watch the toads for a year, you will understand <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#7865;</span>t<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i>! The toad is always on the hunt for its good fortune, food and mates, it is capable of being still for a long time. Its capacity for being still and alert testifies to patience, which is the quality that brings <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span> rere</i>, a good consciousness. The toads have a few enemies, of which the snake is the most important.</p>
<p class="indent">Quite appropriately, this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> speaks of how the toad <span class="small">&#8211;</span> and also the vulture <span class="small">&#8211;</span> initiated the snake into If<span class="small">&#225;</span>, but then realized it was not a good idea. The snake is associated with <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> and the concept of wickedness. Thus encountering the snake in <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#7865;</span>t<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i> signifies that we need to be careful and patient in order to avoid inviting wickedness into our lives, whether in the form of enemies and false friends, or as negativity and poison in general. Rather, like the toad that turns what it has into a haven, and the vulture who realized its duty is to Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span>, we should always be patient and avoid making judgments. Such themes are represented by <i>at<span class="small">&#243;</span>ka</i> (the lapwing) a symbol of a restless mind, worries, and the way in which faith brings success. Just as the vulture realized that he was not doing what he did for humans, but for the greater good, so the lapwing represents what is done for the greater good, but is abhorred and ridiculed. Still, the lapwing does what it does with little concern for opinion.</p>
<p class="indent">Another bird, restless and jumpy, prone to heart palpitations and headaches, is <i>ak<span class="small">&#225;</span>p<span class="small">&#242;</span></i> (the quail), which serves as a symbol of protection against the threat <a id="page_319"></a>of <i>ik<span class="small">&#250;</span></i> (death). It is ironic to realize that this feeble bird, the restless relative of pheasants, symbolizes <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> as he is hunted down by Death because of the agony caused by his own scapegoating, bad decisions and lack of understanding. This leads <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> to realize that justice is not about delaying forgiveness, nor is it about any <span class="small">&#8216;</span>might is right<span class="small">&#8217;</span> ideology. Rather, it is about his hawklike powers becoming jumpy, like a quail with a heart attack in the making, confronted with Ik<span class="small">&#250;</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">This <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> teaches that the world is like the <i>e<span class="small">&#233;</span>ran</i> grass (<i>Digitaria debilis</i>), which is invasive and tends to attack every noble plant. We must protect our noble status, for in a world like ours, <i>e<span class="small">&#233;</span>ran</i>, which is a symbol for the spirits of <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i>, has been given a cosmic sanction to tempt us into the realization that doing good is what brings abundance and a happy fortune.</p>
<p class="indent">This dilemma is represented by the <i><span class="small">&#x0275;</span>g<span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i> tree (<i>Manihot esculent</i>), the tree of prosperity, also known as manioc. <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#7865;</span>t<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i> tells of how this tree is guarded by a ram, a goat, a dog and a rooster that will take down anyone who tries to climb it, because whosoever scales the tree will be prosperous. The verse tells of several people who attempt to climb the tree only to fail. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>, however, goes to his <i>awo</i> to make a divination to see what he must do in order to gain good fortune. His <i>awo</i> tells him to feed and befriend the guardians, and in doing so he will be able to climb the tree and harvest prosperity. In truth there was no tree to climb, just an illusion bestowed upon a shrub a few feet tall that was made impossible to climb by the presence of its guardians. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> had to recognize and appease the obstacles to his good fortune. He needed to realize how to walk towards his goal, because good fortune was well within his reach. <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#7865;</span>t<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i> tells of the importance of ordering our priorities, especially in relation to spirituality and wealth, given that the concept of ambition is born here.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#7865;</span>t<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i> speaks of the importance of friends being present in our lives so we can accumulate good fortune. This is demonstrated in the tale of <span class="small">&#7884;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span>b<span class="small">&#233;</span>rinj<span class="small">&#7885;</span>, who left his hometown in search of fortune in another city. He had one friend in that city, but this friend was too busy to introduce him to other people and help him establish his trade. It was frustrating for him, being a stranger in a strange land, and speaking in a dialect not understood by many. But he decided to stay strong in his search for good fortune and did not curse his struggles, and so it happened that luck found him one day as he was fetching water. Here he met another stranger who was in a similar position to himself and together they made plans <a id="page_320"></a>for how to prosper. As they were discussing these matters a third person entered the conversation and as they spoke a plan came into being. They recognized one another<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s skills and strengths and carefully planned their venture based upon them. Alas, it so happened that some of these skills were more appreciated by other traders, and so envy started to grow amongst the three friends. They were however wise enough to seek counsel from If<span class="small">&#225;</span> and their <i>awo</i> when they noticed that tension had developed between them, and their <i>awo</i> told them that success would be accomplished as long as they stuck together, because shared fortune is preferable to that gained through renouncing your friends. This is encoded in the following verse:</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent"><i><span class="small">&#204;</span>w<span class="small">&#7885;</span><span class="small">&#x025A;</span>t<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i></p>
<p class="noindent"><i><span class="small">&#200;</span>mi <span class="small">&#x025A;</span>t<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i></p>

<p class="noindent"><i>D<span class="small">&#237;</span>a f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n Al<span class="small">&#8217;</span>or<span class="small">&#237;</span> ire m<span class="small">&#225;</span> l<span class="small">&#8217;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span>s<span class="small">&#x0275;</span> ire</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><i><span class="small">&#7864;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span> n<span class="small">&#237;</span> w<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>n n<span class="small">&#237;</span> k<span class="small">&#243;</span> w<span class="small">&#225;</span><span class="small">&#225;</span> <span class="small">&#7779;</span>e</i></p>
<p class="noindent1"><i>If you mark one leg</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>Mark also the other leg</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>When one marks one and the other they become two</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>Then you have marked the two legs</i> (<i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#7865;</span>t<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i>)</p>
<p class="noindent"><i>This If<span class="small">&#225;</span> divined for the one who had a good consciousness but had weak legs</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>He was advised to perform sacrifice</i></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This verse also speaks of the essential nature of <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#7865;</span>t<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i>, being a hunter for good fortune, with a mind that recognizes it, but does not always possess the wisdom to move the legs in a rhythm that invites fortune in. This verse speaks of the importance of harmony, of how the left side and the right side should be in harmony with a joyous and interested consciousness. This is accomplished through the practice of patience.</p>
<p class="indent">In this regard, we find the story of a man called Al<span class="small">&#243;</span>r<span class="small">&#237;</span>, who had a good <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> but weak legs and came to earth after wishing all good fortune for himself. He was very skilful at making quality products, but these took time and care, and he was confronted with his buyers<span class="small">&#8217;</span> impatience and complaints that he charged too much for his products. He became concerned and went to his <i>awo</i> for divination. <a id="page_321"></a>His <i>awo</i> told him that he was doing everything correctly, but that he needed to pay attention to his legs. His <i>awo</i> prepared an <i>o<span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span> <span class="small">&#232;</span>r<span class="small">&#242;</span></i> for him that he used to wash and clean himself, especially his legs. As he did this, good fortune came to meet him. The story speaks of the importance of presenting oneself truthfully, which calls upon honesty, not excuses and scams. In this case, Al<span class="small">&#243;</span>ri knew his products were of a very high quality but he failed to demonstrate this. His walk (or presentation) was not in agreement with what he offered. The story suggests that Al<span class="small">&#243;</span>ri was too shy or reserved in stating how good his products were, and thus his <span class="small">&#8216;</span>legs,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> caused him not to achieve his promised success. This story also tells of the balance between what we have to offer and its quality. If what we have to offer is good, we should speak well of it. We should not feel timid in stating our satisfaction of what is good, whether it is material or spiritual. <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#7865;</span>t<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i> is about what we have to offer, which is something we should speak of, whilst our accomplishments should be kept quiet, as advised in <i>Ot<span class="small">&#249;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>, because of envy. To praise the quality of what you have to offer invites a very different energy from that which you invoke by expressing satisfaction in your life and personal achievements.</p>
<p class="indent">There is clearly a tendency in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> to pay attention to wickedness and wrongdoing. But it speaks of the importance of defining and solving your own problems before you attempt to solve those of other people. You can never offer the remedy to a problem you haven<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t solved yourself. It tells how confrontation and accusation are always tokens that you have not walked gently in the world, and it announces a healing of the soul.</p>
<p class="indent">Another story speaks of the time when <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> was in charge of the world, together with <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> and <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span>, who were his students and confidants. It is a variation on the themes presented in <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> and <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>. The story tells that <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> also brought two messengers, <span class="small">&#210;</span>j<span class="small">&#237;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#630;</span> Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span> and <span class="small">&#204;</span>g<span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#224;</span>n If<span class="small">&#630;</span> (forces of contrast), who would report what was going on in the world to him. As time passed and they saw how people misbehaved, they grew bitter and wanted to see the human race wiped out. And so they started to report what was going on in the earth falsely, to ensure that wickedness was punished. Problems started to mount up on the earth, confusion, fighting and disagreements were plentiful, and <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>, <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> and <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> could not understand how such chaos was possible. They went to their <i>awo</i> for divination, who revealed that the two messengers were responsible for the chaos because they reported their sentiments and not the facts. The <a id="page_322"></a>two messengers were discharged and sentenced to death due to their falsity, and this created further chaos. The people of Il<span class="small">&#233;</span> If<span class="small">&#x0275;</span> accused <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> of being the author of misfortune by sentencing the messengers to death. Accusation upon accusation piled up as they refused to listen to reason and responded with physical aggression towards <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> and <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>. It all ended with <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>, <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> and <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> deciding to leave Il<span class="small">&#233;</span> If<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>, declaring that no spirit worker or <i>awo</i> would ever help the people in the city when they had gone. The people were happy to see the three of them leave. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>, <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>, and <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> found a place deep in the forest where they made huts in which to live, and dedicated their lives to the cultivation of wisdom. In their absence, the city entered a dire crisis. Poverty and barrenness became widespread, but worst of all the rain ceased to fall and the sun scorched the fields. As matters became worse, they desperately sought a diviner. They went to diviner after diviner, but no solution was offered. Finally they found one who took pity on them, and he told them that the cause of their misfortune was the offence they had committed against their benefactors. They had replaced reason with anger, and they were themselves the authors of the pain and misfortune they were suffering. He told them:</p>

<p class="indent">He told them to offer an antelope in sacrifice. They immediately started to search for an antelope, but none was to be found. Finally, after weeks of searching, they encountered one. The antelope, however, noticed the agitation of the hunters and ran away from them. She ran deeper and deeper into the forest and they followed her as best as they could, but they lost her. Searching in the depths of the forest they found the three huts of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>, <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> and <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span>. Curious about who would build huts so deep in the forest, they threw a stone at one of them. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> came out of the hut, looking around for who had thrown the stone, and the hunters stepped forward and threw themselves down upon the ground before him, begging forgiveness. On hearing the commotion, <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> and <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> emerged from their huts. The pleading and begging became more fervent. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> was not impressed, telling them that it was he who had withheld <a id="page_323"></a>the rain and allowed the sun to scorch them so that not only would bird, mammal, rodent and fish die, but in particular the ungrateful human beings. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> and <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> stepped up and argued that they, as humans, were dependant upon the same things, so in exterminating the food for humans and humans themselves he would also present problems for them. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> listened to <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> and <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>, and released the rain, allowing the natural balance to be reinstated. It was on this day when <i>ajog<span class="small">&#250;</span>ns</i> dominated the world that he was praised as <span class="small">&#8216;</span>The White Death.<span class="small">&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="indent">This narrative encompasses the whole of <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#7865;</span>t<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i>. It speaks of the world being perfect as it is, and questions the amount of interference we should exert in order to change its course, no matter how bad it looks or how much power we have to effect such a change. The verse speaks of chaos, misery, loss and sadness being conditions that invite us to cultivate good character. It also tells of the negative consequence of accusations and judgment: to blame and to scapegoat. The If<span class="small">&#225;</span> verse serves as a reminder that we cannot really know everything and that it is not necessarily correct to assume that something external is the cause of our misfortune. Just as the crab moves in a different manner from human beings and hides in dark places, we should realize the difference in the world is an echo of a cosmic rhythm in which what is good for one person is bad for another. Our world is generated by the combined forces of <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> and <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>nd<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>, and <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#7865;</span>t<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i> is the indwelling spirit of our world and condition. This <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> speaks of the challenges caused by this energetic fusion. <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> is the marketplace and <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>nd<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> is the power of the hunter revealed in the promise of victory. In other words, our world is truly a marketplace where we all are the authors of our fate, we are all hunters after good fortune. On account of this, <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#7865;</span>t<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i> pays attention to the legs, which represent ancestry, the memory of who we are and the capacity of walking the world gracefully, as we unleash blessings and situations that challenge us to be better men and women.</p>
<p class="indent">The crab is a symbol of Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>kun Asoranday<span class="small">&#7885;</span>, which is the memory of the wisdom <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> left on earth as he went to <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run in <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i>. He left the crab as a symbol of misfortune transformed into joy. We must recognize that we cannot know everything, and that avoiding passing judgment can open up the <span class="small">&#8216;</span>mysterious walks of the crab<span class="small">&#8217;</span> to our understanding. Hence the crab is taboo in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, it is set aside for contemplation. The walk of the crab should stimulate reflection concerning our own movements in the world.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_324"></a>This mystery is related to a popular story that speaks of the <i>al<span class="small">&#225;</span>gemo</i>, the chameleon. In it, we learn that <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> sends Chameleon as his representative to speak on his behalf in front of Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span>. Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span> dressed up in marvellous garments, to show off his glory, and Chameleon dressed up in the same fashion, just as he did when <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> was challenged to measure power with Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>kun in <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#242;</span>s<span class="small">&#249;</span>n m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i>. Seeing how Chameleon was equally well dressed, Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span> changed into even more spectacular vestments, and Chameleon mimicked whatever he dressed in. This went on for a few rounds until Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span> decided to give praise to Chameleon and to the wisdom of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span>. The verse speaks about adapting one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s self to any environment. It tells of the importance of allies and friends, in order to possess what fate has in store for you and to demonstrate that if heaven and earth are in harmony, good fortune will ensue.</p>
