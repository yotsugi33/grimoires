<p class="indent">This verse calls upon us to practise humility, which we do by paying attention to consciousness, character and the practice of sacrifice. The underlying idea is encoded in a part of an <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span>k<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> from this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>: <span class="small">&#8216;</span>Be truthful, do good, be truthful, do good, it is the truthful ones who the divinities support.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> This verse also implies that achieving this goal involves conscious attention and the practice of sacrifice. To practice sacrifice in this context, applied to <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> (consciousness) and <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>w<span class="small">&#224;</span></i> (character), means the constant work of developing good character through truthfulness and endurance. It is through this type of sacrifice that we can eventually possess wisdom.</p>
<p class="indent">The verse also comments that <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> is responsible for children being born alive, a mystery of the <i>funfun</i> (white) spirits directly related to gestation, such as Koori and Ooge, spiritual phenomena such as <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>b<span class="small">&#237;</span>ku</i> (infant death syndrome) and <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>beji</i> (twin births), which are in turn related to Eg<span class="small">&#250;</span>ng<span class="small">&#250;</span>n, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span>ny<span class="small">&#236;</span>n and <span class="small">&#7864;</span>w<span class="small">&#224;</span>. It is an <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> encoded in the placenta of the gestating womb. It stresses the limits of what we can know and at the same time it emphasizes the importance of seeking wisdom <a id="page_282"></a>and truth, no matter how occult and evasive the paths towards them might be. It is about establishing a balance between endurance applied to good goals and the arrogance born from feeling intellectually superior.</p>
<p class="indent">One story tells of how <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> was asked to travel to the people of <span class="small">&#192;</span><span class="small">&#225;</span>n<span class="small">&#250;</span>. At the time of the invitation, he was going through a rough patch. He didn<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t have much money, nor a wife or family that might help him on his journey. Consequently, he went to the house of his students for divination and the above verse appeared. His students told him that no matter how wise he was, he now needed to attract compassion, so he should not be too eager to show off. He was told to feed his If<span class="small">&#225;</span> and to make a sacrifice to <span class="small">&#204;</span>y<span class="small">&#224;</span>m<span class="small">&#237;</span> <span class="small">&#210;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#x025A;</span>ng<span class="small">&#224;</span>. He sold some of his belongings to gain the funds to perform the <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span></i> and ensure a successful journey. The sacrifice being made, he went to <span class="small">&#192;</span><span class="small">&#225;</span>n<span class="small">&#250;</span> and gave his full attention to the help required by the people there, and the city prospered. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> always made it clear that he could not have done this for the people there if it hadn<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t been for their compassion and help, which led to them showing their appreciation for his work in such magnitude that he became a very rich man.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>p<span class="small">&#x025A;</span>n</i> is about servitude and it is a lesson in humility. The humility spoken of is not a matter of abasing yourself, but of modesty. It is about realizing that we all have our battles and anticipating this in sweet comprehension when we meet other people. We can realize the blessing of a good intellect, whilst acknowledging that it has its limits. A good mind might know how to plan a garden, but other forces are needed to actually make it manifest.</p>
<p class="indent">In this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> we are called to remember our heritage, and this memory rests not only at the feet of Eg<span class="small">&#250;</span>ng<span class="small">&#250;</span>n, but also in the presence of the frailty of gestation. Gestation is a delicate matter, an act surrounded by good will and hope, but at times death and deformity occur. The entire process is a meditation upon our own mortality and becoming, a phenomenon of creation that should inspire us to be modest and sweet in the content contemplation of our achievements. Indeed this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> speaks of the bones of the body as much as of the secrets of the placenta, and in this intuition and endurance is born.</p>
<p class="indent">The <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> speaks of health and immunity, of plants that heal and herbs that kill. It is here that If<span class="small">&#225;</span> says the Elders of the Night took residence at the heart of the forest; or, in other words, at the centre of mystery itself. This mystery repeats itself in the commencement of menstruation on the 28th day, the lunar, or hidden, cycle of events. Surely, the blood flowing is spoken of in <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>ros<span class="small">&#249;</span>n</i>, the vehicle <a id="page_283"></a>in <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>d<span class="small">&#237;</span></i>, but the reason is veiled in the night of <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>p<span class="small">&#x025A;</span>n</i>. This enigma is glimpsed in a most mysterious verse of If<span class="small">&#225;</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">If we read carefully, we see that the witch was not asked to make any sacrifice. The human, however, was asked to make sacrifice but refused. Later, seeing that life was not as good as expected, the human decided to make the sacrifice, but <a id="page_285"></a>did so with bad words, resentment and hatred towards the witch. Humankind seeks pleasure, and curses whatever challenges it. The reality is that the forces that challenge what we have are those which test us, so that we can retain what is good through endurance, and leave what is bad. But as we see, humankind desired only pleasure and not worth, and any force that challenged the hunt for pleasure was deemed hostile.</p>
<p class="indent">The pain announcing menstruation is a reminder, and signals the presence of the witches. This <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> is not an <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> of witches, but of their memory and mark. In the same way that the witches left a mark of monthly agony, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> left his <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>k<span class="small">&#237;</span>ns</i> and <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>p<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>l<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i>, instruments of wisdom, in his place as he left the earth. That he left his tools of divination serves as a reminder that If<span class="small">&#225;</span> is a practical tool for solving situations and problems. <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>p<span class="small">&#x025A;</span>n m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> tells that <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> left for <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run through Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>kun Al<span class="small">&#242;</span>y<span class="small">&#243;</span>, meaning through the secrets of the ocean.</p>
<p class="indent">Witches in If<span class="small">&#225;</span> are related to our emotions, that which comes through our breath, thought and mind. It is these which call upon <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i> (witches) and <i>ajog<span class="small">&#250;</span>ns</i> (spirits of difficulties). The Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span> language does not have a specific word to designate stored up feelings; so the emotional part which Western man fills with worry, insecurities, pleasure and desire does not really exist in If<span class="small">&#225;</span>. There are really no Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span> words to describe the emotional content of a human being, apart from pleasure and vengeance. Everything else is lodged in thought and behaviour as the faculties that generate emotions in the human being, and so it sometimes happens that <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i> and <i>ajog<span class="small">&#250;</span>ns</i> will be invited in.</p>
<p class="indent">This <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, the truth finder, is about using the intellect and being calm about what we invite into our soul. Our soul consists of breath and thought, and it is through these faculties that we invite or deny entrance. What we invite with thought starts to grow in our hearts and takes the shape of emotions. The developing emotion takes on the quality of the thought that invited it in, meaning, if abundance was the energy beneath your thought this is what you will plant in your soul, but if worry and hatred is what you invited in, the child of these thoughts will be emotions that add to your obstacles.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>p<span class="small">&#x025A;</span>n m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> directly follows <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i>, which tells of wickedness, and therefore signals the importance of making our good fortune in the midst of hostility and wickedness. This condition is represented by the scrotum. The relevant verse speaks of how <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span>, <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n and <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#x0273;</span><span class="small">&#x025A;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#236;</span> wondered about where to place the seeds for regeneration in the design of the human being. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> said that <a id="page_286"></a>they should place them between the thighs, because they would both be protected there and nurtured by the heat needed to keep the semen alive. When <span class="small">&#7864;</span>p<span class="small">&#x025A;</span>n (scrotum) was made aware of his destiny, he objected and said that he was a delicate being, and the legs would certainly crush him. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> said it would nevertheless be so, and assured Scrotum it would be fine, that his enemies would never be able to hurt him, that this was the best place for him. <span class="small">&#7864;</span>p<span class="small">&#x025A;</span>n made sacrifice to ensure his good fortune and indeed, he found what <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> had said to be true. He was kicked left and right, but the legs were not able to hurt him. The lesson of this story is that it is important to realize who and what we are, and not pretend to be something we are not. <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>p<span class="small">&#x025A;</span>n m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> contains a wealth of stories speaking of the importance of being true to yourself, no matter what that is, and to avoid pretence of any sort. We find a reminder of this in a proverb from the <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>:</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>id<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> tree (<i>Terminalia glaucescens</i>) possesses antifungal properties and is widely used for oral hygiene. It is also associated with the story of two friends who were together in all things, through good times and bad times, and shared everything. One day they decided to go to their <i>awo</i> to ask if their friendship would always be this good, and what would come of it. The <i>awo</i> told them that good things were coming to them both, but that they should make sacrifice to ensure that these would not create a rift between them. Only one of them made the sacrifice and good fortune came to him in greater haste than to the other. Envy surged in his friend, who started to plot against him, reaping shame as his reward:</p>

<p class="indent">Here the <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> touches upon how selfishness, pride, egotism and arrogance are activated by one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s failure to use the intellect as a guide to doing what is right and good. What is right and good is to work upon one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s own good fortune and fate and not to occupy oneself in measuring the success of others and making judgments over whether they deserve it or not. We should instead learn from successful people. When you envy a friend, it is time to turn your gaze inward and interact with him, or her, as a teacher of prosperity and fate. This humble turn will bring about the greatest <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span></i>, the change of attitude.</p>
<p class="image"><a id="page_287"></a><img src="docimages/f0287-01.jpg" height="100%" alt="Image"/><a id="page_288"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_289"></a>In this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, we find the story of a man referred to as <span class="small">&#8216;</span>He whose mouth is as strong as the <i>akika</i> tree.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> This man was endowed with great strength and a great mind, and so he decided to abolish the world from his life, finding everyone else inferior and pathetic in comparison to his own greatness. He had no friends, nor a wife, no-one was deemed worthy of his company. He worked hard day and night, but saw no end to his efforts; no matter how much he worked, more work seemed to pile up. One day he decided to go for a divination, and his <i>awo</i> told him that he needed to change his attitude towards people. The <i>awo</i> told him that he was himself the author of his problems and told him to make sacrifice and welcome people into his life. He did as he was told, and his life took a turn for the better. He found a good wife and many good friends gathered around him. The story speaks of the need for community and the importance of avoiding focussing on people<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s imperfections. Everyone has their own struggle, and the more we aim towards making other people<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s lives better, the more our own will improve.</p>
<p class="indent">The <i>akika</i> tree (<i>Lecaniodiscus cupanioides</i>) is extremely hardy and prefers secluded and rocky terrain where it affixes its root betweens stones and rocks. The tree is a relative of <i>yohimbe</i> (<i>Pausinystalia yohimbe</i>) and is used in similar ways, namely to fortify erection and male sexuality, as its testicle-like fruits suggest. It has many other medicinal properties, including for oral hygiene. Nearly all trees and herbs in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> have a relationship with the mouth and its cleanliness. It is a reminder to watch our words, because they are born from our thoughts, which are born in turn from our placement in the world and sense of identity. Just as this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> speaks of the importance of friends, it also speaks of the importance of measuring the people you associate with and the presence of bad advice <span class="small">&#8211;</span> again, a reminder to keep the mouth clean in reference to the words you speak. It also speaks of deception by friends and disappointment in them.</p>
<p class="indent">This theme is demonstrated in the story of how 165 snails marched towards their deaths. The snails went to an <i>awo</i> and asked what was going wrong with their journey and were told that they had a friend, calling himself <span class="small">&#8216;</span>Slippery Road,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> who gave bad advice about where to go. They were advised to identify <a id="page_290"></a>Slippery Road and not to listen to him any more. They did as the <i>awo</i> said, and the deaths ceased once Slippery Road had been recognized.</p>
<p class="indent">This <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> deals with false friends, with arrogance and hubris, with people who turn themselves into victims of circumstance by not changing their attitude. It also speaks of ancestry and tradition in contrast to fluctuating and changing social norms. This is underlined by the many stories which tell of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> and <span class="small">&#204;</span>y<span class="small">&#224;</span>m<span class="small">&#237;</span> <span class="small">&#210;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#x025A;</span>ng<span class="small">&#224;</span> as the powers that secure balance in life. This balance is a mystery on several levels. On the first, of how wisdom balances forces that create chaos; on the second, of the importance of getting rid of what is useless to our progress; and on the third, of the tension between tradition and innovation, where what is obsolete needs to make way for renewal.</p>
<p class="indent">This tension between tradition and change is repeated in a story that tells of how <span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#249;</span> (Truth-Walker) married <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>r<span class="small">&#237;</span>n (Laughter), and another that speaks of how he married Eyel<span class="small">&#233;</span> <span class="small">&#210;</span>w<span class="small">&#232;</span>w<span class="small">&#232;</span> (Beautiful Pigeon). In both these stories the truth-walker married women who were extremely beautiful but also quarrelsome and deceptive. In the first story <span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span> experiences great bliss and joy in his marriage, but it turns sour within a few months, because his wife refuses to take anything seriously. She doesn<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t involve herself in building up the prosperity of their home, but is always searching out company and gossip. She is however very charming, and whenever <span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span> asks counsel from family and friends he is silenced and told that he has the perfect wife. One day <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>r<span class="small">&#237;</span>n leaves him and in her absence the truth starts to emerge, but alas, it is too late. In the second story the truth-walker turns into <span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#242;</span>np<span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#242;</span>, a selfish hothead who objects to his wife<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s easygoing ways. The couple are advised to develop <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>w<span class="small">&#224;</span> rere</i> and seek counsel from Eg<span class="small">&#250;</span>ng<span class="small">&#250;</span>n so that wickedness and selfishness can be abolished in favour of obtaining a better perspective on the situation; and the story ends happily.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>p<span class="small">&#x025A;</span>n m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> speaks of the human condition, of the arrogance that develops as a consequence of living in an environment perceived as hostile, and of the hubris and hardiness of soul that can come into being when we exchange compassion for misanthropy. It speaks of this state as one in which bad decisions are made, and false friends given power. This is the root of deception and disappointment. These themes are found in the mystery of Eg<span class="small">&#250;</span>ng<span class="small">&#250;</span>n and its allied societies, Ag<span class="small">&#7865;</span>m<span class="small">&#7885;</span> and <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#x025A;</span>, as well as in the essence of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span>ny<span class="small">&#236;</span>n and <span class="small">&#7864;</span>w<span class="small">&#224;</span>.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="small">&#7864;</span>w<span class="small">&#224;</span>, or <span class="small">&#204;</span>y<span class="small">&#225;</span>w<span class="small">&#224;</span>, whose name means <span class="small">&#8216;</span>Beauty<span class="small">&#8217;</span> or <span class="small">&#8216;</span>Mother of Beauty,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> exemplifies the balance between beauty and wisdom. She is a reminder of <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>w<span class="small">&#224;</span></i>, as represented <a id="page_291"></a>by a beautiful, and curious, woman. <span class="small">&#7864;</span>w<span class="small">&#224;</span> is a river deity, associated with springs, and is linked with <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span>ny<span class="small">&#236;</span>n, <span class="small">&#7884;</span>bal<span class="small">&#250;</span>way<span class="small">&#233;</span> and <span class="small">&#210;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>m<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#232;</span>. She is described as both the rays of the sun as well as fog and mist and the colours of the rainbow. She is seen in the chameleon<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s ability to change in conformity with its environment: she is not the change, but the potential for transformation. She is also associated with cemeteries; her physical beauty will decay, so it is necessary to develop inner beauty. In this she is related to Eg<span class="small">&#250;</span>ng<span class="small">&#250;</span>n as a force of mystery, symbolized by the fog and mist (which in If<span class="small">&#225;</span> represents the fertility of night), the mysterious dimensions we cannot fully understand, only perceive, appreciate and use.</p>
<p class="indent">A legend tells that on account of her beauty she was constantly visited by men who asked for her hand in marriage. None of them saw beyond her amazing physical beauty, no one saw that she was the mother of character. Time passed and the whole affair made her sad, and so she went to her <i>awo</i> for a divination. On meeting <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>, she realized that it was wisdom she wanted, and so she made sacrifice to become wise. Before long she started to dissolve into rays of sun and rainbows, mist and fog; she became wisdom resting within character.</p>
