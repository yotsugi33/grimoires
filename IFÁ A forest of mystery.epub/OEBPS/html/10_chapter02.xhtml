The origin of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> is, like the meaning of the word If<span class="small">&#225;</span>, subject to several interpretations. I believe that all of them are true and speak of how the spirit of <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> manifested in various timeless, wise and prophetic forms across the spheres in order to uphold mystery, wonder, awe and wisdom.</p>
<p class="indent">One myth tells how <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> came from <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run (heaven) together with many other spirits and deities and settled in Il<span class="small">&#233;</span> If<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>. He decided to move to the outskirts, to a place called <span class="small">&#210;</span>k<span class="small">&#232;</span> <span class="small">&#204;</span>g<span class="small">&#232;</span>t<span class="small">&#237;</span> (Igeti Hill). After living there for some time, he <a id="page_68"></a>decided to move to Ad<span class="small">&#243;</span> <span class="small">&#200;</span>k<span class="small">&#237;</span>t<span class="small">&#237;</span>, where he stayed most of his life. While living in If<span class="small">&#232;</span>, he fathered eight children, princes who took possession of various districts in western Africa. He taught his sons, as well as eight other students, the art of If<span class="small">&#225;</span> divination. One day a student insulted him, and <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> returned to <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run. The sons and students went to <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run as well and searched for <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>, trying to persuade him to return. He refused, and instead gave them the authority to use the sixteen <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>k<span class="small">&#237;</span>n</i> (palm nuts) so they could read the cosmic matrix themselves.</p>
<p class="indent">Another story is given in Johnson<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s <i>The History of the Yorubas</i>, where he relates that the If<span class="small">&#225;</span> cult came to the Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span>s from the Nupe people by means of a blind sage named Setilu. His expertise had made the Muslims living in the area jealous, so Setilu left and found his way to present day Benin and then to If<span class="small">&#232;</span>. According to this myth the progenitor of the Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span>s, Od<span class="small">&#249;</span>duw<span class="small">&#224;</span>, sought out Setilu and thus introduced If<span class="small">&#225;</span> to his people. A third myth tells that <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> was born at If<span class="small">&#232;</span> and was a skillful diviner who became a king in spite of his crippled body and weak health. He was considered to be a great prophet and sage and many people came to study with him. Of all these students, only sixteen were chosen <span class="small">&#8211;</span> a reference to the original sixteen districts in Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span>land <span class="small">&#8211;</span> for each sign in the oracular system of If<span class="small">&#225;</span>. These students became chief diviners. A fourth myth says that <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> came from the land of the Muslims and suggests that he was an Arabian mystic with great insight into the divinatory art of <i>khatt al-raml</i>, known as <span class="small">&#8216;</span>sand cutting,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> which is practiced amongst Muslim sages. There are indeed many similarities between these two oracles.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> is known as Eleri Ipin, <span class="small">&#8216;</span>the witness to creation and destiny,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> and as Ibikeji Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span>, <span class="small">&#8216;</span>second to the creator, Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span>.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> Renowned for his wisdom and understanding of humanity and divinity, he is also called Agb<span class="small">&#242;</span>nn<span class="small">&#237;</span>r<span class="small">&#233;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n, an elision of <i>agb<span class="small">&#242;</span>n</i> with <i>ni ire g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i>, <span class="small">&#8216;</span>wisdom of the coconut knows no limits whether of mercy or blessings,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> thus emphasizing his omniscience and compassion. Consequently, he is knowledgeable about all human and divine matters.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="small">&#x011a;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> is the source of all knowledge, and <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> is the keeper of this knowledge. Its oracle, If<span class="small">&#225;</span>, is a binary geomantic system rooted in the contrast of negative and positive. This polarity is the mechanism that upholds life and enables transformation. When If<span class="small">&#225;</span> divination is performed, this binary pattern is always used as a tool for defining what sort of matrix a client finds himself within. Thus, advice is given by looking at examples from the past as they speak of the future.</p>
<p class="image"><a id="page_69"></a><img src="docimages/f0069-01.jpg" height="100%" alt="image"/><a id="page_70"></a></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_71"></a>This is because we repeat patterns already laid down in the cosmic design. The binary monism of If<span class="small">&#225;</span> might appear as dualism, but it is not. It is the necessary contrast that generates being in a mutual a<span class="small">&#64259;</span>rmation of the sacred and spiritual centre. This contrast, which we experience as <span class="small">&#8216;</span>chaos<span class="small">&#8217;</span> and <span class="small">&#8216;</span>order,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> as <span class="small">&#8216;</span>good<span class="small">&#8217;</span> and <span class="small">&#8216;</span>evil,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> is actually a manifestation of the binary ontology of If<span class="small">&#225;</span> that makes understanding possible, that makes a spiritual centre possible.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> is from the source of all beginnings and forms part of the divine consciousness. Both <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> and <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> represent the forces that bridge <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i>, the human consciousness, and <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>p<span class="small">&#242;</span>nr<span class="small">&#237;</span></i>, the divine consciousness. It is accomplished through the key and vinculum of <i><span class="small">&#232;</span>m<span class="small">&#237;</span></i>, which is the divinized soul in man. The concept of consciousness is complex and beautiful, and speaks of a design in which man reflects the divine consciousness. Our consciousness is represented by the physical head, also called <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i>. At the crown of the head, we find our connection to source, <i>l<span class="small">&#225;</span>y<span class="small">&#233;</span> l<span class="small">&#225;</span>y<span class="small">&#233;</span></i> , which is understood to be a state of expressive dreaming. The summit of consciousness is at the same time the cave of the source. At our forehead, we find <i>iw<span class="small">&#225;</span>j<span class="small">&#250;</span> or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i>, the third eye, the gateway for prophecy and clairvoyance. At the base of the skull, we find the crossroads of consciousness, called <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>p<span class="small">&#224;</span>k<span class="small">&#243;</span></i>, which, when aligned with <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span></i>, makes possession possible. Possession is therefore understood as a process that starts within man and vibrates outward in a spiritual frequency, or energy, that we recognize as a natural force, or <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i>.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#204;</span>p<span class="small">&#224;</span>k<span class="small">&#243;</span></i> and <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> represent two forms of memory; the latter is the natural memory gathered by the journey on earth, the former is the divine memory. These meet in <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span> in<span class="small">&#250;</span></i>, the inner head in which we find the seat of self resting upon <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span> <span class="small">&#224;</span>peere</i>, the mirror of the cosmic matrix within the human consciousness. This construct of consciousness enables perfection and degeneration through its constant pull between the contrasts of this world, as it a<span class="small">&#64259;</span>rms the central axis of consciousness, which enables <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>p<span class="small">&#243;</span>nr<span class="small">&#237;</span></i>, the illumination of consciousness caused by being in alignment with the source. The cosmic design is understood to mirror this structure in its binary dance towards clarity and understanding, and it is <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> who possesses the knowledge that can connect our consciousness to the cosmic. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> mediates between each and every state of being and every realm, and it is these patterns which are read when If<span class="small">&#225;</span> divination is performed.</p>
<p class="indent">The priests of If<span class="small">&#225;</span> are called <i>babal<span class="small">&#225;</span>wo</i> from <i>baba nl<span class="small">&#8217;</span>awo</i>, meaning <span class="small">&#8216;</span>father who has the secret.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> These secrets are disclosed in myths and stories, prayers and songs. By manipulating the oracle of If<span class="small">&#225;</span>, the <i>babal<span class="small">&#225;</span>wo</i> will reveal given signs.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_72"></a>These signs come with advice and procedures in order to resolve the situation in question. For <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> there are never any problems, just situations, and for every situation there is always a solution to be found within the corpus of <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> If<span class="small">&#225;</span>. The corpus of <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> consists of sixteen main signs, called <i>m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i>, meaning <span class="small">&#8216;</span>twins<span class="small">&#8217;</span> or <span class="small">&#8216;</span>pairs,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> which are combined with each other to produce the full 256 combinations. These sixteen principal <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span>s</i> and their properties are as follows:</p>
<p class="number1"><span class="list_num">1</span> <i><span class="small">&#200;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span> Ogb<span class="small">&#232;</span></i> is the first of the energetic wombs in the cosmic matrix of creation, and represents expansive light.

It is darkness, inhalation and the womb that gestates the light. This <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> concerns the temporary absence of light as it undergoes a mystical transformation, the process by which all things are ensouled.</p>
<p class="number1"><span class="list_num">3</span> <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>w<span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> is the power of transformation, the root of consciousness shaped by the poles of light and darkness, the blueprint of self and psyche, and the fire of passion.

It is an <i>od<span class="small">&#250;</span></i> in which we grasp our power and cling to the rope of fate; which can bring epiphanies and delusions, the energy of both the prophet and the charlatan.</p>

<p class="number1"><a id="page_73"></a><span class="list_num">7</span> we tend to look upon as negative, can be seen from multiple perspectives. It is from here that <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> derives his powers, a veritable crossroads, and the storehouse of change and choice.</p>

It enables balance between the worlds, with the heart as the spiritual centre. It speaks of the dark night of the soul and all the distress a heart can cause. It is the energy of contemplation as well as regret, as much as it is about setting good and fair goals and the failure to achieve them.</p>

An energy denoting victory and strength, as well as the importance of force being supported by other powers in order to move elegantly and graciously in the world.

It is an energy that reminds us how soft and delicate the heart of the world is; just like our own soft and delicate four chambered heart. This <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> is a call to awareness.</p>

We might say that this <i>od<span class="small">&#250;</span></i> is the blinding chaos, the reversed black hole that offered up light as the source of beginnings before beginnings, a pre-Titanic energy that is the origin and end of all that exists.</p>

This shell, with its perfect, pyramidal spiral shape symbolizes transformation in time and by extension transformation in the life of humans.</p>
<p class="indent">The birth of <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>, and the manner in which he came to preside over this specific <i><span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#7865;</span></i>, is told in the <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span> <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>, which explains the type of <i><span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> the divine beings possess and what purpose they serve. <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> is a direct reference to <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>, symbolized by one of his most important aspects, the one who transports the offerings, <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>jise-<span class="small">&#7865;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span></i>. This is made evident by his character as <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> Elebo, whose domain is to control and regulate the <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span></i> (ritual offering). <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> is also called El<span class="small">&#232;</span>r<span class="small">&#249;</span>, <span class="small">&#8216;</span>Lord of Er<span class="small">&#249;</span>,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> carrier of rituals.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> is the spiritual force that reestablishes the harmonious relationship between the <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>y<span class="small">&#224;</span>m<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> (volatile powers of hexing and cursing) and the sixteen <i><span class="small">&#243;</span>r<span class="small">&#237;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span>-<span class="small">&#224;</span>gb<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> or the sixteen primordial <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span>s</i>, thus saving the earth from chaos and annihilation. He is the only divinity who can open the gates to <span class="small">&#210;</span>run, and so the harmonious and dynamic relationship of <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>run-ay<span class="small">&#233;</span></i> (the invisible and visible realms) is caused by him. Through this role, <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> is present in all activities that contain movement and transformation, as the same <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>t<span class="small">&#224;</span>n</i> says: <span class="small">&#8216;</span>Everything, every being could not be without its own <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> in its constitution, it could not exist, nor could it be aware of its existence.<span class="small">&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="indent">In all processes <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> is the element that simultaneously solidifies and transforms the <i><span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#7865;</span></i>. <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> is found in the lives of men when they come to <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>na pade</i>, the <span class="small">&#8216;</span>juncture in the road.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> We can associate this with a situation where a choice has to be made.

As the manifestation of choice, <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> can be considered to be man<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s foremost teacher on the path towards his destiny. He is choice itself, being neither good nor bad, and therefore the very power of transformation, whether the choice made is a good one in which our decisions bring good fortune, or a bad one which brings us lessons that demonstrate a need for growth and understanding.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> is the one who carries the <i><span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#7865;</span></i>, and as such his position amongst men is mirrored in the cosmic design. <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> is the power of change <span class="small">&#8211;</span> he is the mercury of transformation <span class="small">&#8211;</span> and this is as true of the choices we make, as it is of the fusion of elements and energies that generates the 256 varieties of consciousness.</p>

He gave the realm of sunrise to <i>Ogb<span class="small">&#232;</span></i> and sunset to <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>y<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>k<span class="small">&#250;</span></i>. <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>w<span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> was given the north gate and <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>d<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> the south gate, and the remaining four <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span>s</i> were placed in balanced opposition to each other: <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#242;</span>s<span class="small">&#249;</span>n</i> at ene, <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>w<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>nr<span class="small">&#237;</span>n</i> at wsw, <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> at nnw, <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>k<span class="small">&#224;</span>nr<span class="small">&#224;</span>n</i> at sse, <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>nda</i> at ne, <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> at sw, <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> at nw, <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>p<span class="small">&#x025A;</span>n</i> at se, <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> at <a id="page_79"></a>nne, <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#7865;</span>t<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i> at sse, <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i> at wnw, and <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i> at ese. This organization of power establishes the rhythm and pulse of the world as we know it, where whatever opposes a vibration is also what drives it forward. The medicine and poison is always the same, it is only the situation, the realm of <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>, that changes. The square, with its four sides, replicates the crossroads with its four arms. This reveals that manifestation of spirit in matter is always to do with the crossroads, <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> is always there. This is demonstrated in another design based on Baba Medahochi<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s presentation of this mystery:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="docimages/f0079-01.jpg" class="WDH509" width="509" height="493" alt="image"/></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_80"></a>If we add the directions, up and down, to the square we get the number six, which signifies an astrological trine, being a number of the perfection of Venus, a fundamental harmony brought to the world by <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span>un. If we add to this the tetrarch, the ten numbers signifying cosmic potencies, we have a matrix of sixteen; the sacred number of If<span class="small">&#225;</span>. Sixteen can also represent the dual polarity of the eight winds of the compass rose, a reference to the powers that support equilibrium. Again we are in the domain of <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>. We thereby arrive at this cosmological design.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="docimages/f0080-01.jpg" class="WDH504" width="504" height="504" alt="image"/></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_81"></a>The matrix of creation is rooted in the number sixteen and the cosmic design is composed of 16<sup><b><sup>4</sup></b></sup> resulting in the 256 energetic combinations called <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, meaning <span class="small">&#8216;</span>womb.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> These are understood as points where energy flashes out in its creative permutations. The four elemental forces multiply to generate the basic 16-fold pattern by celestial copulation <span class="small">&#8211;</span> or <i>funk<span class="small">&#233;</span></i>, a spiritual eroticism <span class="small">&#8211;</span> generating the matrix of genesis which is authored by <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> and <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span>un. The 16 primordial potencies engage in another 16-fold copulation to generate the patterns of possibility, the arch, matrix and helix that lie at the root of every nuance of expression known in the cosmic design.</p>
<p class="indent">If<span class="small">&#225;</span> is rooted in a geometric harmony around the pole of existence. Wisdom is the ability to mediate the left hand and the right hand in order to support the polar axis. The left hand represents defence, denial and magic, whilst the right represents the powers of love, bounty and sharing. From the perspective of If<span class="small">&#225;</span>, an excess of either power will cause us to drift away from the centre of self and our connection with the source. <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#x025A;</span></i> (poison) is inherent in the cosmic design, but is only brought forth by excess. Excess of any kind will eventually become a negative power, by which I mean any force or obstruction to our happiness. <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#x025A;</span></i> has a linguistic similarity to <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#243;</span></i>, meaning <span class="small">&#8216;</span>words,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> hence words and breath are at the nativity of what shapes blessings and healings as well as poisons.</p>
<p class="h3">the origin of mystery</p>
<p class="indent">The matrix of the cosmic design is spoken of in the <i>omo od<span class="small">&#249;</span> <span class="small">&#210;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span>g<span class="small">&#249;</span>nd<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>. I will paraphrase the myth as told by Awo P<span class="small">&#243;</span>p<span class="small">&#243;</span><span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> to Awo Fa<span class="small">&#8217;</span>lokun. In the beginning was <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>k<span class="small">&#224;</span>m<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>, a word commonly translated as <span class="small">&#8216;</span>God,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> although it better denotes <span class="small">&#8216;</span>the origin of mystery.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> <i><span class="small">&#192;</span>k<span class="small">&#224;</span>m<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> was a composition of dew, gases and humidity dancing in the darkness. The <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>m<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>l<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i> (primordial spiritual being) called Orig<span class="small">&#250;</span>n shaped these dews and gases into stars and astral bodies. The name Orig<span class="small">&#250;</span>n means <span class="small">&#8216;</span>the consciousness that pounds symmetry<span class="small">&#8217;</span> or <span class="small">&#8216;</span>the one who injects consciousnesses.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> Stars were created as the dew cooled and generated <span class="small">&#8216;</span>houses of light.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> The astral bodies were, as yet, without direction; this was acomplished by <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>m<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>l<span class="small">&#x0275;</span> B<span class="small">&#224;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span> As<span class="small">&#233;</span>m<span class="small">&#249;</span> Eg<span class="small">&#249;</span>n Sunw<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>, whose name can be translated as <span class="small">&#8216;</span>the father who lays down the bone matrices for the overflowing of character.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> The cosmos was given its design. Its matrix was understood to be a combination of the sixteen <a id="page_82"></a>powers which engaged in a cosmic g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n, or copulation with each other. Sixteen times sixteen produces a matrix composed of 256 energetic currents. These comprise the <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, <span class="small">&#8216;</span>womb of energy,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> in reference to their expansive capacity of <span class="small">&#8216;</span>stirring the darkness.<span class="small">&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="indent"><i>Ol<span class="small">&#249;</span> Iw<span class="small">&#225;</span>y<span class="small">&#232;</span></i>, <span class="small">&#8216;</span>the chief of the dwelling of character,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> entered the matrix and solar systems were generated, including our own. All the planets were given to specific <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>m<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>l<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i> to inhabit, and Earth was given to Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span>. So in reverence to her, Earth was called Ile Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span>, the house of Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span>. Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span> found her condition lonely, and sought other spirits to live with her. Here the creation myth has several variations. One story tells how Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span> (chief of the heavenly rainbow) first sent <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n (the power of iron) who brought several other hunter spirits to Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s dwelling to make it habitable. <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n was not successful, so Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span> sent <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> (chief of the white cloth/dreams) who brought several other forces with him, known as <i>funfun</i> spirits, <span class="small">&#8216;</span>spirits of whiteness.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> But he was also unsuccessful, so Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span> sent <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>. On his way to Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span> he met with the babalawos in heaven, who provided him with the seeds necessary to make Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span> habitable. Vegetation, minerals and animals sprouted miraculously from the seeds <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> planted, and beings called <i><span class="small">&#232;</span>n<span class="small">&#236;</span>y<span class="small">&#224;</span>n</i> were placed in Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s habitat. At first everything was harmonious, then these beings started to destroy their home. Seeing this, Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span> ordered the waters to rise and Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span> was covered with water. Most of the <i>en<span class="small">&#237;</span>y<span class="small">&#224;</span>n</i> died, but a few survived, and those were the ones from whom witches, <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i>, and sorcerers, <i><span class="small">&#242;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#242;</span></i>, derived their powers.</p>
<p class="indent">The task of turning Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span> into a habitat was begun again. Once more <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> was sent and once more was unable to complete the task; so Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span> sent Od<span class="small">&#249;</span>duw<span class="small">&#224;</span>. Od<span class="small">&#249;</span>duw<span class="small">&#224;</span> consulted <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> before travelling to Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span> and came equipped with the necessary seeds to generate Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s habitat. The place where Od<span class="small">&#249;</span>duw<span class="small">&#224;</span> started to turn Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span> into a habitat for plants and beasts was called Il<span class="small">&#233;</span> If<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>, the House of Love. In the House of Love humans were created in a variety of forms, which we call <span class="small">&#8216;</span>races<span class="small">&#8217;</span> today. This is the stage of creation we are in now and If<span class="small">&#225;</span> warns that human beings will try to control and subdue nature instead of living in harmony with it. The threat of global destruction will call upon the spirit of wisdom, <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>, to perpetuate the world, and a return towards traditional and harmonious living will slowly spread over Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span>. There are some striking similarities with the If<span class="small">&#225;</span> creation myth and what is spoken of in <i>Poimandres</i> where Hermes Trismegistus speaks of the fall of man as his unification with <a id="page_83"></a>the powers of nature, mirroring how the divine mind has <span class="small">&#8216;</span>fallen into creation.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> Man, being the result of the divine mind, is a spiritual being, a divinity veiled in matter and nature. It is from this matrix that the <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> If<span class="small">&#225;</span> are born, and <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> is the mediator between these cosmic patterns that are <span class="small">&#8216;</span>born<span class="small">&#8217;</span> or manifested during If<span class="small">&#225;</span> divination. Whilst <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> reveals the matrix, <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> moves it. The movement of <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> is understood to be like the magma at the centre of the earth, like rivers of lava in subterranean tunnels, and these caves and tunnels are the dwelling of the spirit of wisdom, <i><span class="small">&#x011a;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span></i>.</p>
<p class="h3"><span class="testing">&#x0118;</span>l<span class="testing">&#224;</span>: the heart at the spiritual centre</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="small">&#x011a;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> is the spirit of wisdom, understood to be the witness to fate, though the name is di<span class="small">&#64259;</span>cult to translate. <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> is a word that conveys expansion. What <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> expresses is its own self-expression, a rain of divine wisdom, which we recognize by its power to give <i>imo</i>, <span class="small">&#8216;</span>illumination.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> Terms like <i>w<span class="small">&#224;</span></i>, <span class="small">&#8216;</span>to be brought to life<span class="small">&#8217;</span> and <i>if<span class="small">&#249;</span>r<span class="small">&#233;</span></i>, <span class="small">&#8216;</span>to be brought into consciousness,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> are further qualities belonging to the expansive and active wisdom of <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>. As such, <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> is the power that enables expression of any kind, the power that moves the matrix and helix of creation to bring forth all things. <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> is said to reside in caves and informs the network of subterrestrial arteries of Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span> through its mysterious and concealed presence. Traditional symbolism equates the cave with the heart, and the heart with Polaris, the north where perfection resides. North is the direction given to the <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>y<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>k<span class="small">&#250;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i>, which signifies the darkness of the womb, meaning that <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> is the spirit that moves, in its expressive force, beneath mystery and transformation, and brings what gestates in darkness and concealment into becoming. As such the cave represents the spiritual centre, as reflected in the heart. <i>In<span class="small">&#250;</span></i> is the word that signifies every concealed cavity, whether physical or symbolic. The understanding of the heart and cave as spiritual centres of the world represents the concealed and mysterious character of <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> being the heart of the spiritual centre found in the cosmic design. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> is a manifestation of this power in his capacity of understanding the <i>oro</i>, words/sounds/phonemes of the matrix of creation encoded in the 256 <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span>s</i> of If<span class="small">&#225;</span>. This matrix of 256 combinations and nodes can be understood as the mysterious laws of the cosmic design, its pre-established harmony which dances between the poles of light and darkness, healing <a id="page_84"></a>and cleansing. This cosmic play is replicated in man when he builds <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>w<span class="small">&#224;</span></i>, or <span class="small">&#8216;</span>character,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> in conformity with the understanding of the particular combination of cosmic powers that constitutes the foundation of our consciousness and being. In this we can understand what fate really is.</p>
<p class="indent">Fate is a particular law born from a gathering of energetic vibrations brought into harmony by wisdom, and our ability to understand the transformative quality of the cosmos. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> is the guide on the path of transformation, and transformation is at the core of being. This reveals If<span class="small">&#225;</span> to be an active philosophy of life, resting on a total understanding of the wisdom that comprises the lattices and matrices of the cosmic design. When a divination is performed, it is the spirit of <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> that moves the diviner into an understanding of the cosmic principles at hand, mediated by the memory which he or she possesses of each of the 256 energetic patterns encoded in <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, which will be considered in the following chapter.</p>
