<p class="indent">According to Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span> history and genealogy, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#250;</span>n was the fourth son of Od<span class="small">&#249;</span>duw<span class="small">&#224;</span>, the first king of Il<span class="small">&#233;</span> If<span class="small">&#x0275;</span> and the ancestor of the Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span> people. This fourth son was actually named Fagbamila, but received the nickname <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#250;</span>n, which means <span class="small">&#8216;</span>uprightness rests within<span class="small">&#8217;</span> in reference to his perfection in all ways. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#250;</span>n received a cutlass named Ogbo (the Elder) from Od<span class="small">&#249;</span>duw<span class="small">&#224;</span>, which he used to clear sixteen paths in all directions from Il<span class="small">&#233;</span> If<span class="small">&#x0275;</span> to ensure the spread of Od<span class="small">&#249;</span>duw<span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s legacy. This repeats a theme concerning kingship that we saw earlier in the case of <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span>, the fourth ruler of <span class="small">&#7884;</span>y<span class="small">&#7885;</span> state. Again, we are met with the fourth taking on a particular position. The fourth <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> is <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>d<span class="small">&#237;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i>, which is associated with the concept of <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>nw<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> or rebirth. In other words, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#250;</span>n brought a mythical principle to perfection through the birth of a ruler who contained the mystery of creation within himself, and who was truly of an upright character. We can therefore understand <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#250;</span>n to be the force that succeeded in spreading the message of Od<span class="small">&#249;</span>duw<span class="small">&#224;</span>, whose name means <span class="small">&#8216;</span>character is from the womb<span class="small">&#8217;</span> or <span class="small">&#8216;</span>character rests in the darkness of the womb.<span class="small">&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="indent">Here, If<span class="small">&#225;</span> is revealed ultimately to be a philosophy of character, and its diversity. <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i> speaks of three types of people: the achievers, those who follow them, and the bystanders. It adds that those who are wise in their achievements will always be recognized by their calm and joyous disposition. From this, we can see that <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i>, as the progenitor of our world, provided it with two things, upright character and diversity. <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i> states that human beings came to this world to do good, to be wicked, or to do nothing, and this demonstrates the three principal temperaments represented by the three colours, white (calmness), red (vibrancy) <a id="page_342"></a>and black (darkness). The social classes were born from these temperaments, and with social division there came envy and judgment, ambition and aspiration, as well as resistance to one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s fate. <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i> states in one verse that <span class="small">&#8216;</span>If<span class="small">&#225;</span> is sweeter than honey,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> which serves to remind us that any fate is destined to be a happy one, and that each of us is the author of our fate. Our destiny is a search for fulfillment, happiness and abundance, but fate is a power that invites constant choices as to which act is best suited to this end.</p>
<p class="indent">These ideas are represented by the parrot, a most important bird in <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i>, where he is a symbol of nobility. One verse speaks of how the parrot wanted to be seen as being more than merely beautiful, and made sacrifice to <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>. <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> invested him with all kinds of powers and instructed him in how to reap the good will of several <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i>. He became seen as a powerful assistant, a noble power in his own right, through giving loyal and unfaltering assistance to <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span>. Consequently his red tail feathers are used in all initiations, as a sign of spiritual authority calling upon clarity of mind.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i> speaks of how man is free to choose between good and evil, and stresses the importance of understanding plants and animals as aids in how to apply wisdom in our choices. It is an <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> that speaks of how everything is connected to its source. <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> tells of the two poles of creation are a splendour of dazzling light that originates from a single source, and of how our experience in the field between the splendour on the right, and that on the left, creates a landscape of contrasts and extremes. The human journey is embarked upon in this field. We learn through the accumulation of experience and the practice of character that the legs of <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i> stand solidly in light and in darkness, and understand that we are beings of upright character. <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i> is the source of light. Light was made manifest in <i><span class="small">&#200;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span> Ogb<span class="small">&#232;</span></i>, which opened the road for the human experience riddled with choice, oaths and oath breaking, commitments and the breaking of commitments, love and hatred. Our being and our experiences are reflections of various forms of light, rays, frequencies, perceptions of the possibilities released by <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i>, as the world was created for the sole purpose of leading us to a realization of that original light and whiteness in which our character was born. The beginning and end of the human journey rest in the realization of an upright character. In one verse, the state of the world as generated by <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i> is said to be as follows:</p>

<p class="indent">This verse refers to the story of the broken calabash in <i><span class="small">&#200;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span> Ogb<span class="small">&#232;</span></i>, in which the calabash of character was brought from heaven to earth and dropped, as <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> stepped onto the mountain of the world, and its contents were spread everywhere. Thus, If<span class="small">&#225;</span> teaches that our world is broken, that we need to reassemble the shards of wisdom into their original unity, both on a personal and global level. The restoration of the world is assigned to the founding of the <span class="small">&#7884;</span>gb<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>ni society, which is attributed to this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. The <span class="small">&#7884;</span>gb<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>ni society is a council of If<span class="small">&#225;</span> elders who venerate <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>nil<span class="small">&#233;</span> and have been assigned the duty of mending the world by aligning themselves with its wisdom.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_344"></a>Dr. Abosede Emanuel (2000) revealed some parts of the myth of the foundation of <span class="small">&#7884;</span>gb<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>ni in his book on the <span class="small">&#8216;</span>Od<span class="small">&#249;</span> If<span class="small">&#225;</span>.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> He writes of how <span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n met a limbless woman at the gate of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run on one of his journeys between heaven and earth. <span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n took pity on the woman, and asked her to return to earth with him, so he could heal her and make a dwelling for her there. She agreed and they went with him. When they came to the triple junction that separated heaven from earth she asked <span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n to stop and told him that her condition forbade her to dwell in the city or to travel during the day. As they were waiting at the crossroads, A<span class="small">&#7779;</span>ipa, the guardian of the junction, came and helped them cut a road through the thicket until they found a grove where they made a hut which he decorated with palm fronds for her to live in. This hut had no natural entrance and the <i>ak<span class="small">&#242;</span>ko</i> tree was planted there to mark its location. The dwelling of the limbless woman was called Iled<span class="small">&#237;</span>, meaning <span class="small">&#8216;</span>The entrance of the house is strange.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> After settling the woman in her reclusive dwelling, <span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n went to his confidant, Apena, to speak with him. Apena had been looking for a wife, and <span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n thought the limbless woman would be perfect for him. Apena agreed and went to her hut to ask her to marry him. She agreed on the condition that he swore an oath never to reveal her condition to anyone and that any visitors coming to her had to be blindfolded, except for <span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n and his court of If<span class="small">&#225;</span> priests (which refers to <span class="small">&#7884;</span>gb<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>ni members). The marriage between the limbless woman and Apena was good and they had two children. The first one was named Ogbo, the Elder, in reference to wisdom, and the second one was called Oni, a word signifying to take deep possession of something, which we might translate as <span class="small">&#8216;</span>keeper.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> It is from the names of these two children that we derive <span class="small">&#7884;</span>gb<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>ni, <span class="small">&#8216;</span>Keepers of the wisdom of the Elders.<span class="small">&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="indent">We find this mystery encoded in the way in which the <span class="small">&#7884;</span>gb<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>ni society is organized. The elder of the <span class="small">&#7884;</span>gb<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>ni society is a woman.

The chief of <span class="small">&#7884;</span>gb<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>ni has two assistants, Apena and Gesi. Apena is a priest of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> who acts as Od<span class="small">&#249;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>a<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s right hand (<i>otun</i>), bestower of abundance and fortune, while Gesi holds the power to regulate taboo and secrecy, as represented by the left hand (<i>osi</i>).</p>

Baba Ad<span class="small">&#233;</span>wuy<span class="small">&#236;</span> writess in his as yet unpublished magnum opus <i>Secrets of Od<span class="small">&#249;</span> If<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>: <span class="small">&#8216;</span>the mark (<span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n) signifies the establishment of darkness rooted in a mystical phenomenon.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> This means that we need to develop our inner light and realize our true spiritual origin in order to find our way in darkness, which is the practice of character. As another verse says:</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent"><i>If the earthworm pays homage to the earth</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>the earth will give it access</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>a little child never pays homage and is found</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>to be destroyed in consequence of it</i></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> speaks of the first creation of the world and of how when <span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n was confronted with the wickedness on earth he called upon <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span> to rule the world with him. <span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n himself was stern, merciless and kept ruthlessly to what was right and pure, while <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span> took delight in punishing all wickedness. At some point the inhabitants of earth grew tired of their despotic ways and gathered together in an attempt to expel <span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n and <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span> from earth. Following this incident <span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n, together with <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n and Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>kun, decided that <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> should be the chief of the world. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> brought the spirit of <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> to earth, and allowed its wisdom to penetrate the earth as it had done in heaven, so that everything in creation could be wise. <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>, however, preferred to dwell in caves and subterranean tunnels where she holds communion with Od<span class="small">&#249;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>a. <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> was the first <i>babal<span class="small">&#225;</span>wo</i> of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run, the principle of wisdom itself, whose name is usually translated as <span class="small">&#8216;</span>heaven knows salvation,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> in a call to human beings to bring divine wisdom into their lives so that the darkness can become enlightened.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i> explains why we tend to see the world in dualist terms, as the right and <a id="page_348"></a>the left hands fighting each other. This is caused by the panorama of human experience spanning from darkness to light. <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i> is the closed calabash of mystery, but when the mystery is exposed, experience generates various forms of perception and philosophies in accord with the concept of diversity found here.</p>
<p class="indent">The return to origin is made possible through <i>t<span class="small">&#233;</span>f<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>, If<span class="small">&#225;</span> initiation. <i>T<span class="small">&#233;</span>f<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> takes place in <i>Igb<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, the forest of mystery. This word speaks of a place where Igbad<span class="small">&#249;</span> is present, either in the forest where she is naturally encountered, or in a designated space where she has been brought into presence. <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i> imparts that the first name of Od<span class="small">&#249;</span> was <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#x025A;</span> I<span class="small">&#7779;</span>ek<span class="small">&#250;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span>e, meaning <span class="small">&#8216;</span>the profound word reveals itself in crooked ways and acts.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> In this first form she was taken to a place called Igb<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span> in the forest to be raised. This is where everyone who undertakes initiation into If<span class="small">&#225;</span> goes.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i> is about union and perfection, and how diversity is a necessary experience to achieve this realization. This realization is accomplished by unifying the top and bottom of the calabash, to see everything as variations originating from the one. If<span class="small">&#225;</span> accomplished this by entering into marriage with Od<span class="small">&#249;</span> and in this unification a profound realization of the harmony encoded in the world was revealed to <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> in the 256 <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> If<span class="small">&#225;</span>. It was from this alliance that <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> realized that the secrets of upright character were to be found in the brightness of primordial light and the cool waters of origin, as one verse says:</p>

<p class="indent">The brightness of <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i> is found in the <i>oj<span class="small">&#250;</span></i> (eyes). The eyes were created by <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> to be the pathfinders of the body and soul. Great responsibility came with this position and as such the eyes became the guide of the human being. In If<span class="small">&#225;</span>, the eyes are related to days and hours and the experience of first light. The word <i>oj<span class="small">&#250;</span></i> is related to the days of the weeks and the months of a year and denotes a capacity for observation. The eyes point the way and observe the world, but the use we make of the experience of the world which the eyes transmit to us falls outside their domain. The eyes do not judge, the <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> is what judges.</p>
<p class="indent">As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> is concerned with diversity, social roles, and classifications. Consequently, it also speaks of succession and timeliness. It speaks of how phases within our life can be as shifting as social positions. We find here a story about <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#250;</span>n, who was childless in spite of his greatness. He had many wives, but was not able to father a child with any of them. He went to his <i>awo</i> for a divination and was told that he would indeed father a child. It would be a male child that would be be prestigious and famous. Before the year was out he indeed fathered a male child who was called Ariwo<span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span>. However, at the naming ceremony of the child, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#250;</span>n was told that Ariwo<span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> would outshine his already glorious father. Therefore <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#250;</span>n decided to send his child out from the city of <span class="small">&#204;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> to be raised by people he could trust not to reveal his royal heritage. Ariwo<span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> grew up rapidly, and gained prestige, honour and followers and was treated as royalty. When he came of age he decided to visit his father in <span class="small">&#204;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> and he dressed up in whiteness, glory and splendor with a host of followers in his train, to bear witness to the visit. As Ariwo<span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> entered his father<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s city the people of <span class="small">&#204;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> said that a king even greater than their great <a id="page_350"></a>king <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#250;</span>n had arrived. None of them knew this was the son of their king. They welcomed Ariwo<span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> as a true king and his father realized that the time had come for him to abdicate the throne to his son, which he did. Ariwo<span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> entered the history of Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span> as one of their greatest kings ever. The verse speaks of the importance of making room for new powers and acknowledging that one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s work has been done so that it is possible to move on to new experiences as much as it speaks of the importance of accepting the shifting state of Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span>. <span class="small">&#210;</span>r<span class="small">&#225;</span>ng<span class="small">&#250;</span>n demonstrated greatness in his acceptance and the manner in which he avoided resistance; in this way he perpetuated his legacy and name for the benefit of all the people.</p>
<p class="indent">Acceptance and resistance are related to Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>r<span class="small">&#237;</span>re, the Lucky One. <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i> imparts that the concept of luck <span class="small">&#8211;</span> to be at the right place at the right time with the means to take advantage of the situation <span class="small">&#8211;</span> rests in a spirit of acceptance and interest. The If<span class="small">&#225;</span> medicine known as <i><span class="small">&#7885;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#7865;</span><span class="small">&#232;</span>r<span class="small">&#242;</span></i> was created here as a means of attracting luck and expelling resistance. <i><span class="small">&#7884;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#7865;</span><span class="small">&#232;</span>r<span class="small">&#242;</span></i> is a combination of enchantments and powders fused with black soap (<i><span class="small">&#7885;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#7865;</span>d<span class="small">&#250;</span>d<span class="small">&#250;</span></i>) that expels negativity and creates an opening for luck and good fortune. This remedy was offered to Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>r<span class="small">&#237;</span>re at a time when people were trying to kill him out of envy, and he wanted to find an alternative solution to retaliation. He used the <i><span class="small">&#7885;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#7865;</span><span class="small">&#232;</span>r<span class="small">&#242;</span></i> and their hostility soon turned into praise and fame. This avoidance of hatred and enmity is in contrast to the story of <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>r<span class="small">&#249;</span><span class="small">&#250;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>mi.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="small">&#x011a;</span>r<span class="small">&#249;</span><span class="small">&#250;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>mi was a manufacturer of bean cakes and was well known for the quality of her products. She was, however, greedy and jealous with her bean cakes, and refused to give anything for free to anyone, even if they were hungry or in order to demonstrate the good quality of her products. One day the chief of the witches came to the market where <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>r<span class="small">&#249;</span><span class="small">&#250;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>mi was frying bean cakes and begged her for a taste. <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>r<span class="small">&#249;</span><span class="small">&#250;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>mi refused, but the witch insisted and pleaded until <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>r<span class="small">&#249;</span><span class="small">&#250;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>mi told her to get lost, as she was not in the market out of charity. As night fell, the chief gathered the other witches together and told them how she had been shamed in the market by <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>r<span class="small">&#249;</span><span class="small">&#250;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>mi. They decided that she had to be punished for her lack of generosity. The night after the incident, the witches sent the birds and animals over which they had control to reside around the dwelling of <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>r<span class="small">&#249;</span><span class="small">&#250;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>mi and, from then on, terror, dread and nightmares infested her life. In a matter of days she had withered away from fright so much that she expected death at any moment. It was then that she went to her <i>awo</i> for divination. <a id="page_351"></a>Her <i>awo</i> told her that this situation had been generated by her insulting behaviour and lack of charity, and that she needed to make peace with the witches by offering them bean cakes for free for the next three days. She did this, and on the third night the birds and animals which had been sent to torment her departed. After this, she returned to the market, only to discover that her business was gone. Another person had taken over her business, the people preferred to buy from them and were no longer interested in what she had to offer.</p>
<p class="indent">This is an important story as it highlights compassion, generosity and charity. We are all in the same situation, the human journey, and on this journey a helping hand receives help in return. The attitude displayed by <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>r<span class="small">&#249;</span><span class="small">&#250;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>mi attracted a negative vibration. The story says that the witches caused this situation, but in this particular incident it was not <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i> that came to her, but another spiritual intrusion, which is known as <i><span class="small">&#232;</span><span class="small">&#232;</span>m<span class="small">&#242;</span></i>. <i><span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#232;</span>m<span class="small">&#242;</span></i> is a disruptive force that takes joy in inspiring pain and sorrow and feeding bodily filth in order to ignite feelings of dread, fear and negative mental states. This is an interesting class of spirits, as they are reputed to inspire antinomian and rebellious attitudes which are seen as an illness of the soul that attracts false friends or as <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i> says: <span class="small">&#8216;</span>companions of common darkness.<span class="small">&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="indent">No matter how much we try to change the wicked ones we need to be prepared for the persistence of wickedness, as it is something we attract on the human journey. It is a consequence of bad choices. If bad choices are perpetuated, more will follow. You are bound to find yourself in hostile environments as life progresses, and every hostile situation invites acceptance and resistance, retribution and blessing. In every predicament in which the emotions are hot and provocation is close, a calm and cool character will always provide the best solution. The following verse captures this well:</p>

<p class="indent">There is one story which combines those elements of luck, cleanliness, acceptance, generosity and resistance which occur in the stories of <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>r<span class="small">&#249;</span><span class="small">&#250;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>mi and Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>r<span class="small">&#237;</span>re, and addresses the importance of love. This story speaks of how <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> was going to marry Ij<span class="small">&#243;</span> (Dance), Ay<span class="small">&#242;</span> (Joy) and Ad<span class="small">&#249;</span>n (Sweetness). He was advised to treat these women with respect, recognition and love. Initially he did so, but as life went well for him he became careless, with everything from his personal hygiene to attending to his clients and business. Whenever his wives tried to reason with him he told them to back off and leave him be. One day they had enough of his attitude and left him, and with their departure, all things joyous, <a id="page_353"></a>sweet and worthy left his life. In this story, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s bodily hygiene was addressed, on the basis that all other issues of soul and mind would be resolved by taking care of the cleanliness of his body. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> solved this problem by collecting 201 If<span class="small">&#225;</span> leaves: he reduced these to ashes while reciting words of power over them and mixed them into black soap. He made a ceremony for his <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> and his If<span class="small">&#225;</span> and washed his <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>k<span class="small">&#237;</span>ns</i> and his body and committed himself to cleanliness of body, mind and soul. In doing so, he accepted love, joy, sweetness and good fortune into his life. A part of one verse says:</p>

<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i> is concerned with the abuse of power and with overestimating one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s capacity for both giving and resisting. It provides us with many stories of the failure of good intentions, or of aspirations that are not fully achieved. <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i> speaks of the importance of completing our tasks and setting worthwhile goals which we can pursue diligently. In doing good for others, remember to first do good for your family.</p>
<p class="indent">Around 70 herbs, shrubs and trees are associated with <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i>. The three which are most important and sacred to Od<span class="small">&#249;</span>, and indispensable to If<span class="small">&#225;</span> in general, are:</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>d<span class="small">&#250;</span>nd<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i> (<i>Kalanchoe crenata</i>), an edible plant with many medicinal properties. It can be used to speed up recovery from wounds and respiratory problems. It serves as a remedy to remove irritation from the eyes and is associated with gentleness and sweetness spreading across the earth. It thrives best in the forest in dark, humid places, but can thrive under the sun in dry soil.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>T<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>t<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>r<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i> (<i>Costus sp</i>.), a plant sacred to <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span>. It is a relative of ginger and <a id="page_354"></a>saffron, and is associated with ancestry and ancestral wisdom. This species of plants is one of the few that exists in a healthy symbiosis with ants. The plant provides cover for the ants and in return they protect the seed bulbs instead of consuming them. The plant is used to ward off death and enemies, as demonstrated by its medicinal use of curing bites from poisonous snakes.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Rinrin</i> (<i>Peperomi pellucida</i>), also known as Pepper Elder, is used to wash the eyes of the <i>awo</i> before seeing Od<span class="small">&#249;</span>, hence it is thought to be the plant used to build the hut of the crippled woman who became the chief of <span class="small">&#7884;</span>gb<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>ni. It has several medicinal properties, one of which is to combat inflammation, irritation of the eyes, and a host of other impediments ranging from rheumatism and fever to gout and renal disorders. The plant is edible and rich in nutrients. It prefers humid places and possesses an extraordinary capacity to spread out and take over abandoned and rocky areas.</p>
<p class="indent">What these plants have in common is a capacity to spread out and enter into amiable liaisons with whatever climate and soil they are confronted with. They demonstrate the importance of standing upright, overflowing with qualities that bring health, joy and clarity of mind. These plants are like mountains of power and healing and the mountain is ever a symbol of upright character, as the following verse states:</p>
