<p class="noindent"><a id="page_326"></a><i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> is an <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> of inspiration, beauty and wealth and is usually attributed to the work carried out by spiritualists and priests. It is related to the concept of abundance. The word <i><span class="small">&#x025A;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i> signifies <span class="small">&#8216;</span>triumph<span class="small">&#8217;</span> and also <span class="small">&#8216;</span>cleanliness<span class="small">&#8217;</span> and is related to great achievements in which the power of <span class="small">&#8216;</span>doubt<span class="small">&#8217;</span> is, at times, invited in as a contrast to the greatness and abundance spoken of here. The reference to <span class="small">&#8216;</span>victory<span class="small">&#8217;</span> is due to <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#630;</span> having many enemies both in <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run and on earth. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#630;</span> however made sacrifice in order to become victorious over them.</p>
<p class="indent">This relationship is represented by the story that tells of how the diviners Al<span class="small">&#224;</span>ti<span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#233;</span> Il<span class="small">&#233;</span> and Al<span class="small">&#224;</span>ti<span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#233;</span> Oko went to Ejigbomekun, the land of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#630;</span>, to initiate him into If<span class="small">&#225;</span>. He was asked to bring 20 sticks (<i><span class="small">&#242;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n<span class="small">&#x025A;</span>p<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>) along with his sacrificial materials. Two of the sticks would be used for the sacrifice. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span> gathered everything together and, as he went to his diviners carrying the load on his head, he fell, and the sticks reserved for use in the initiation broke in two: hence <i><span class="small">&#x025A;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i> also means something broken, as in the proverb, <span class="small">&#8216;</span>two sticks broken in the middle is what we call <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i>.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> A reference to shared wisdom increasing the abundance of the one who shares. The proverb serves as a reminder that no matter how strong something seems to be it can always be broken: this applies to sticks as much as it does to enemies. This <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> speaks of the disastrous consequences of breaking one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s oath, one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s word or one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s commitments, no matter what disagreements or disappointments are involved in the situation.</p>
<p class="indent">A proverb related to this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> says: <span class="small">&#8216;</span>We should not gossip about a friend, because of our pact. Even if the friend is of one mind and you of another our path should not deviate. Every monkey has his place as every soul has its own path.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> This verse is encoded in the alternate name of <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i>, which is <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span> <span class="small">&#210;</span>l<span class="small">&#250;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>d<span class="small">&#224;</span>n</i>. I will paraphrase the story of <span class="small">&#210;</span>l<span class="small">&#250;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>d<span class="small">&#224;</span>n from P<span class="small">&#243;</span>p<span class="small">&#243;</span><span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s (2009) thorough presentation of this key verse.</p>
<p class="indent">In<span class="small">&#225;</span> (fire) went to If<span class="small">&#225;</span> in pursuit of a cure for her barrenness. If<span class="small">&#225;</span> told her that a fertile time had come, that she would be blessed with a male child and so it came to pass, within the year she gave birth to a baby boy. In the naming ceremony for the child, it was revealed that the child was a <i>babal<span class="small">&#225;</span>wo</i> from heaven who had incarnated. He was to be named <span class="small">&#204;</span>n<span class="small">&#224;</span>ki, in honour of his mother, and placed in the care of the <i>babal<span class="small">&#225;</span>wos</i> for training. As a young man he became very proficient in If<span class="small">&#225;</span> and especially in curing infertility, which caused women to flock around him. It was indeed grace that he gave, because his If<span class="small">&#225;</span> medicine was always very simple, consisting of scrapings of brass, powdered yam and <i>iyerosun</i> to carry the <a id="page_327"></a>enchantments of this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. <span class="small">&#204;</span>n<span class="small">&#224;</span>k<span class="small">&#236;</span> was very successful, and his students became equally successful. One student in particular, <span class="small">&#210;</span>p<span class="small">&#243;</span>, came to be as great as his teacher. It was <span class="small">&#210;</span>p<span class="small">&#243;</span> who the elderly Ol<span class="small">&#250;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>d<span class="small">&#224;</span>n (the king of Ibadan) approached for aid in his attempt to father a child on his equally elderly wife. <span class="small">&#210;</span>p<span class="small">&#243;</span> prepared the If<span class="small">&#225;</span> medicine to be given to his wife and she became pregnant, giving birth to a healthy child named Atie, meaning, <span class="small">&#8216;</span>Born from the elderly.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> Ol<span class="small">&#250;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>d<span class="small">&#224;</span>n asked <span class="small">&#210;</span>p<span class="small">&#243;</span> for the same thing the following year and once again he fathered a boy. Three years later, Ol<span class="small">&#250;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>d<span class="small">&#225;</span>n approached <span class="small">&#210;</span>p<span class="small">&#243;</span> again, saying that he wanted more children, and again <span class="small">&#210;</span>p<span class="small">&#243;</span> prepared the medicine and again Ol<span class="small">&#250;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>d<span class="small">&#224;</span>n<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s wife became pregnant and this time gave birth to a girl, named Nnkan, <span class="small">&#8216;</span>Something.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> This girl turned out to be Apet<span class="small">&#7865;</span>bi, the wife of If<span class="small">&#225;</span>, sent from heaven, and he was told that she should only marry a practicing <i>awo</i> to keep good fortune close to her. When the time came, Ol<span class="small">&#250;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>d<span class="small">&#224;</span>n wanted to offer her hand in marriage to <span class="small">&#210;</span>p<span class="small">&#243;</span>, but he was not to be found anywhere, and so she was offered in marriage to <span class="small">&#210;</span>p<span class="small">&#243;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s good and wealthy friend, Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>wo. Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>wo however was not a practicing <i>awo</i> and thus the taboo concerning the girl was ignored.</p>
<p class="indent">Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>wo was a celebrated military general and he came to love Nnkan very much and took her with him to all his battles. It so happened that after several years of marriage Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>wo was faced with a challenging battle. In order to arrive at the battlefield he had to cross the <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span>un river, but the river was overflowing, and it was impossible to pass. Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>wo went to the river, and told <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span>un that he didn<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t have anything to offer, but if she made way for them, he would give her something when they returned. The river parted and let them pass. They returned successfully, but the river was once again full upon their return. Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>wo threw honey and palm wine into the river, but they were rejected, he threw she-goats and jewellery into the river, but they were rejected. Everything he threw into the river was rejected. As he stood there, frustrated and confused by the rejection of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span>un, his commander approached him and told him that he had promised to give <span class="small">&#8216;</span>something<span class="small">&#8217;</span> (<i>nnkan</i>) to <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span>un, and that only giving Nnkan to <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span>un would ensure success. In disbelief he gave his wife to the river, expecting her to be rejected, but the river accepted her. The consequence of the sacrifice of the daughter of Ol<span class="small">&#250;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>d<span class="small">&#224;</span>n led to a blood feud between the two families that became legendary all over Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span>land.</p>
<p class="indent">We see here how <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i> is concerned with the dynamic between <span class="small">&#8216;</span>victory<span class="small">&#8217;</span> and <span class="small">&#8216;</span>being broken.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> In this story we have different kinds of victors and we have the <a id="page_328"></a>presence of a woman who causes a great feud and breaks the two families that were once united. It emphasizes the importance of the oath, and how easily we are dethroned and destroyed by carelessness and promises made in haste. It demonstrates the dire consequences of doing what needs to be done and thus stresses the fragility of words, promises, relationships and social positions. We can see the importance of woman in this story, and as we shall see later, the concern with fertility, children and womanhood in general, makes this a feminine and venereal <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> that speaks of how everything is shifting, like the moon.</p>
<p class="indent">We find here the presence of female forces like <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span>un, mother of <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> and wife of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>; Yem<span class="small">&#242;</span>w<span class="small">&#243;</span>, wife of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> and source of artistic creativity; and Aj<span class="small">&#233;</span> <span class="small">&#7778;</span>aluga, wife of Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>kun, associated with beauty and wealth. These forces hold the potential for beauty, creativity, wisdom and abundance. It is an <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> much concerned with feminine powers that calls upon the presence of <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> in the form of birds (<i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i>).</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i> speaks of woman as a source of abundance and how maltreatment of woman is a source of poverty. One story tells of the beautiful and elegant Aje <span class="small">&#7778;</span>aluga, who was possessed of a good and quick mind. She came to the world responsible for financial wealth, sure that this would attract much benevolence and kindness to her. <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> tells us that she had several relationships with different men, all of whom mistreated her and did not give her any value besides venerating her beauty. She became tired of constant failure with men and went to her awo for divination to see what she could do to find a good husband who would see her for what she was. She was advised to make a sacrifice in order to attract a good husband. At the same time, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> was struggling with poverty; he had a lot of clients, but no-one would compensate him financially for his work. This situation had gone on for quite some time and so he went to his <i>awo</i> to see what could be done about it. His <i>awo</i> told him that he should not worry about any of this, that his good fortune would come to him through a woman, but that he needed to make a sacrifice. On the day of the <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span></i>, he came to his <i>awo</i><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s house, and saw Aj<span class="small">&#233;</span> <span class="small">&#7778;</span>aluga, who was also there to make her <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span></i>. During the <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span></i>, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> asked if this was the woman who would bring him abundance and she in the same fashion asked if <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> would be the man who would treat her well and understand her. If<span class="small">&#225;</span> affirmed this and before long a marriage was arranged between the two. Things immediately started to change for them, and they prospered greatly together, having children, money and all good things in life.</p>
<p class="image"><a id="page_329"></a><img src="docimages/f0329-01.jpg" height="100%" alt="Image"/><a id="page_330"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_331"></a><i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i> speaks of how prosperity is brought about by the use of intellect, care and cunning, and addresses the use of force. This is illustrated by several examples that use wrestling to typify the energies of this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. Wrestling is popular in rural Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span>land and is done as exercise and to demonstrate one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s strength and agility as a husband for a prospective wife. It represents the balance between strength and softness needed to bring forth harmonious togetherness.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i> is an <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> that speaks of the union of what is broken and how sameness and difference can enter into a higher union. We might understand <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i> as being a mirror with two observers, one on either side of it, each of whom sees themselves in the other. The presence of the mirror is a reference to the beauty and supremacy integral to this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. It also warns that beauty and deception walk hand in hand, as illustrated in <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> by stories that speak of the presence of false friends who are attracted to beauty and wealth alone. This can bring about confusion over whom one can trust, and hence disappointment with people is a recurring theme in <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i>.</p>
<p class="indent">These issues are demonstrated in the story about another beautiful woman, L<span class="small">&#225;</span>p<span class="small">&#224;</span>de. She was not only beautiful, but accomplished in all ways. At a young age, she decided that she would marry a <i>babal<span class="small">&#225;</span>wo</i> and devote herself to her family, which she did. She was praised for her beauty and revered as a symbol of female accomplishment. However, she was disturbed by nightmares and fears concerning her future. She feared death and she feared betrayal and abandonment. One day, she went to her <i>awo</i> to ask for a divination to see if her bad dreams were rooted in worry, or if they were omens foretelling disaster ahead. The verse recited to her was the following, as collected by P<span class="small">&#243;</span>p<span class="small">&#243;</span><span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> (2009):</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="small">&#8216;</span>roof of fear<span class="small">&#8217;</span> spoken of in this verse is a reference to the <i><span class="small">&#232;</span>kan</i> grass (<i>Imperata cylindrica</i>), which is sacred in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> and used to enhance fertility. But there is more to this grass, which is also sacred to <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span>. It is highly flammable and is used to thatch roofs and to stabilize the soil. The Japanese <span class="small">&#8216;</span>blood grass<span class="small">&#8217;</span> is an ornamental relative of this medicinal weed, whose roots and shoots also serve as food. The <i><span class="small">&#232;</span>kan</i> grass is used by two of the birds sacred in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> <span class="small">&#8211;</span> <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>par<span class="small">&#243;</span></i> (partridge) and <i>olongo</i> (orange cheeked waxbill) <span class="small">&#8211;</span> to build their nests. They nest on the ground, making these nutritive and medicinal nests vulnerable to mites, <a id="page_333"></a>ants and predators. Partridge is taboo in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, because of its relationship with financial success as a bird sacred to Aj<span class="small">&#233;</span> <span class="small">&#7778;</span>aluga. The <i>olongo</i> holds an even deeper symbolism, as it represents both beauty and cunning, evident in its acrobatic and elegant behaviour. It is a beautiful and smart bird and is contrasted with <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>g<span class="small">&#242;</span>ng<span class="small">&#242;</span></i> (the ostrich) which represents agility and strength. One verse in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> speaks of a time when Olongo did not have her beautiful colours, but was rather insignificant. Olongo admired the ostrich with her long legs, speed and grace, being herself one of the smallest birds in the world. One day, the ostrich announced that she would set out on a journey and asked the other birds who would accompany her. Olongo was excited at the opportunity, and said that she would come with her, but she also went to her <i>awo</i> to make a divination. She asked if giving support to the ostrich in this journey would make her become as strong and fast as her. The <i>awo</i> told her that this was not Olongo<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s place; rather, she should pay attention to her own special talents, because she was Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s symbol of beauty and prestige. Olongo was asked to make a sacrifice of coloured cloths and a goat. After the sacrifice was made, <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> came in the night and turned the feathers of Olongo to the beautiful reddish brown and gold she has today. She went with the ostrich on her journey, and they reaped praise for the strength and beauty that could only occur through their harmonious togetherness.</p>
<p class="indent">Beauty requires support, because it is fragile and delicate. This kind of beauty supported by strength and wisdom is attributed to Aj<span class="small">&#233;</span> <span class="small">&#7778;</span>aluga and <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span>un as <i>apet<span class="small">&#7865;</span>bi</i> (wives) of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>, where beauty and wisdom joined together provide truth and abundance. It is in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> that <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span>un is celebrated as the perfect wife of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>, as the embodiment of beauty, elegance and eroticism. The erotic contains the mystery of making use of cleanliness and sweet scents to generate attraction. This <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> speaks about finding the other who completes you, just as it speaks of giving away your beauty for nothing out of disappointment and fear. It was in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> that <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span>un, in the absence of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>, took care of his clients who had come to If<span class="small">&#225;</span> for counsel and help, giving cowry shell readings and medicine made from cool water. As the owner of the cool, healing waters, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span>un brought the mystery of <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>g<span class="small">&#232;</span>d<span class="small">&#232;</span></i>, a healing ritual that uses the enchanted force of the river, and is performed in every initiation to <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i>. In a story from this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, the <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i> and <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> used the powers of <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>g<span class="small">&#232;</span>d<span class="small">&#232;</span></i> resting in the river to wash away the signs of old age and restore their vitality and vigour.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_334"></a><i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> speaks of the miraculous properties of cool water. This mystery is always performed when, for instance, the <i><span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> of leaves is made into healing waters called <i>omi<span class="small">&#232;</span>r<span class="small">&#242;</span></i>. The leaves are prayed over and then macerated in alcohol and cold riverwater to extract their properties. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span>un is the water that invites such properties to infuse everything, and because of this we find the presence of micro-organisms, bacteria and viruses in this od<span class="small">&#249;</span>, representing contamination and dispersal.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span>un encompasses the mystery of water as a force of healing, beauty and origin. She is associated with the depths (<i>ibu</i>) of all sources of fresh water, as she is the symbol of the womb that brought forth the first human beings on earth in a state of beauty, health and prosperity. She represents menstruation, while Y<span class="small">&#7865;</span>m<span class="small">&#7885;</span>ja represents the use of fertility in giving birth and milk to children. The emphasis on <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span>un as the owner of menstruation, and hence fertility, is veiled in her praise name <span class="small">&#204;</span>y<span class="small">&#225;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>mi Akoko, meaning <span class="small">&#8216;</span>supreme primordial mother,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> a reference to one who holds the secret of birds, as disclosed in <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i>. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span>un, both in her primordial state and as the chosen wife of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>, possesses wisdom in great measure, and is the owner of the cowry shell oracle. This relationship is emphasized in the following verse, which also underlines the importance of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span>un<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s waters and how what is meant to be together should not be broken.</p>

<p class="indent">The theme of isolation, of reacting to good advice badly and separating yourself from others due to disappointment is frequently found here, as in the story of <i>y<span class="small">&#232;</span>r<span class="small">&#232;</span>p<span class="small">&#232;</span></i> (the velvet bean, <i>Mucuna sloanei</i>). The story tells that he came from humble beginnings and no one took much notice of him. He was often neglected when he was young, but as he grew up people became more attentive to his humble wisdom. When he came of age he was considered a very wise man and the dwellers in the forest saw in him a future king. The elders decided that he would be offered the royal staff, because surely he would rule the forest with humility and wisdom. Learning this news he went straight to his <i>awo</i>, asking about how extravagant the celebration should be. The <i>awo</i> told him that perhaps this was not the right approach to the matter, that he should rather be concerned whether he would find success in his position. Y<span class="small">&#232;</span>r<span class="small">&#232;</span>p<span class="small">&#232;</span> was mightily offended by <a id="page_336"></a>his <i>awo</i>, because he had been contemplating malice and wickedness in his heart. He had played the part of being humble and wise for many years in the hope that he would be given the opportunity to get back at those who had wronged him in the past. His heart was full of pain and affliction and it was this which he wanted to inflict on people.</p>
<p class="indent">As soon as he was installed as king, he started with the elders and sprinkled the dust of his nettles on them, generating pain and itching, so horrid that only palm oil on their naked bodies could ease their suffering. This was just the beginning of his reign. In a short time he had managed to drive everyone away from him and he became a despised and hated king, whose only friend was his own desire for vengeance. Eventually the dwellers of the forest had enough of him and decided to end his reign, and so in the night the elders went out into the woods and set fire to Y<span class="small">&#232;</span>r<span class="small">&#232;</span>p<span class="small">&#232;</span>. In flames, consumed by regret, he died.</p>
<p class="indent">The story of Aj<span class="small">&#224;</span>g<span class="small">&#249;</span>nn<span class="small">&#224;</span> highlights some other themes of importance in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. Aj<span class="small">&#224;</span>g<span class="small">&#249;</span>nn<span class="small">&#224;</span> was a general who was installed as the chief of <span class="small">&#204;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>d<span class="small">&#224;</span>n due to his great cunning in the art of war. The more he was praised for his accomplishments, the more his people started to resent him. He was accused of being too stern and demanding, and he constantly met with criticism and opposition from his own people, and even his own family. He could not understand why victory against his enemies should generate such hostility amongst his own people. He went to his <i>awo</i> to obtain some perspective on the situation and was told that this was a lesson, in order that he would understand how difficult human beings were. He was instructed to make sacrifice to <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> and feed his If<span class="small">&#225;</span>, and the <i>awo</i> told him that he needed to come to terms with what it meant to be a leader. Aj<span class="small">&#224;</span>g<span class="small">&#249;</span>nn<span class="small">&#224;</span> became confident about how to solve this situation and decided that the best thing to do would be to move away from all these difficult beings. He went into the forest and found a well hidden <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>r<span class="small">&#243;</span>k<span class="small">&#242;</span></i> grove which he cleared in order to build a house for himself and his family. The people in the city told him that this was not the best course of action, as he had just cut down the trees which the Elders of the Night used to have their meetings in. Aj<span class="small">&#224;</span>g<span class="small">&#249;</span>nn<span class="small">&#224;</span> was distrustful of their advice, after all these people were full of envy, lies and accusations, so why would they tell truth about this?</p>
<p class="indent">Aj<span class="small">&#224;</span>gunn<span class="small">&#224;</span> moved into the house with his family, and not long afterwards the Elders of the Night came to have their monthly meeting, only to discover that Aj<span class="small">&#224;</span>g<span class="small">&#249;</span>nn<span class="small">&#224;</span> had occupied their place and cut down their trees. They gathered in <a id="page_337"></a>another grove close by and decided that Aj<span class="small">&#225;</span>g<span class="small">&#249;</span>nn<span class="small">&#224;</span> had to die for his recklessness, along with his family. In a few days Aj<span class="small">&#224;</span>g<span class="small">&#249;</span>nn<span class="small">&#224;</span> became ill and his condition rapidly went from bad to worse with no cure being found. It didn<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t take long before death came to him, and when death arrived, Aj<span class="small">&#224;</span>g<span class="small">&#249;</span>nn<span class="small">&#224;</span> asked to be given another chance. He told Ik<span class="small">&#250;</span> that he had learned his lesson; he had come to accept that human beings would never be satisfied. He pleaded with Ik<span class="small">&#250;</span>, promising that he would no longer be disappointed, but rather follow the ways and recommendations of <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> and If<span class="small">&#225;</span>.

<p class="indent">The story tells of how confusion and emotional resentment can cause our isolation from the community, and how choices made when we are in a negative emotional state can lead to more bad choices. Hence, salvation lies in acceptance. In isolating himself from his people, Aj<span class="small">&#224;</span>g<span class="small">&#249;</span>nn<span class="small">&#224;</span> managed to anger the Elders of the Night and was afflicted with <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i>. This affliction was something which he provoked by allowing disappointment and a negative emotional state to dictate his choices. One bad decision leads to another.</p>
<p class="indent">This theme is further spoken of in relation to the tree <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>g<span class="small">&#249;</span>ngun</i> (<i>Adansonia digitata</i>), better known as the baobab, which is sacred here and is related to omens. The Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span> name means something that is repeated and gives resonance; the presence of this tree in the world invites us to read omens in nature. The baobab is a loner, and can live up to two thousand years. It illustrates the prestige found in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, but also the tendency to seclusion, as baobabs are rarely found together, but stand alone, guarding their fruits and their many wonderful healing properties in solitude.</p>
<p class="indent">Many of the stories in <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i> speak of disillusion turning into a hatred of the world: this takes the place of the sweetness and prosperity spoken of in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. In some situations we see it take the form of self imposed isolation from the world, at others of a vengeful spirit that seeks to inflict pain upon it. These themes are exemplified by the scorpion<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s sting. <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>j<span class="small">&#242;</span>g<span class="small">&#225;</span>n</i>, the scorpion, gained his sting and poison in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. The story tells of a time when he was bullied and harassed by many enemies. One day he went to his <i>awo</i> to search for a solution <a id="page_338"></a>to this situation, and the <i>awo</i> told him that he should make sacrifice to <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> with needles and spikes along with poisonous herbs and a goat. <span class="small">&#210;</span>j<span class="small">&#242;</span>g<span class="small">&#225;</span>n did as he was told and, as soon as the sacrifice was made, <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> took a needle from the <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span></i> and filling it with poison, fitted it to his tail. He was told to sting whoever tried to attack him and he brought about the death of his enemies and was praised as: <i>T<span class="small">&#237;</span> y<span class="small">&#243;</span><span class="small">&#243;</span> m<span class="small">&#225;</span>a f<span class="small">&#8217;</span>iru <span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>gun <span class="small">&#7885;</span>ta r<span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> (He who conquers his enemies by virtue of his penis).</p>
<p class="indent">At times, this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> is about giving up on life and allowing oneself to succumb to venereal indulgence or illegal activity. In this context, we find a story about two thieves. They became thieves because they didn<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t see any progress in their work and so decided to embark upon a life of crime as a shortcut to wealth. They experienced success for some time, but ended up being shamed by their own people and with their reputations ruined they never managed to embark on anything useful, they were simply marked for life. In this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, any form of illegal work is always spoken of as a consequence of becoming impatient with waiting for good fortune and desiring a short cut to it, or as the result of giving up on the world and seeking retribution in a self-serving spirit. This is entailed in the concept of <i>oj<span class="small">&#250;</span>k<span class="small">&#242;</span>k<span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#242;</span></i>, which is the Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span> word used for <span class="small">&#8216;</span>greed,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> <span class="small">&#8216;</span>envy<span class="small">&#8217;</span> and <span class="small">&#8216;</span>avarice.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> The word itself means <span class="small">&#8216;</span>to see the world as an insect.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> Hence to display these attributes is synonymous with the invasive effect of micro-organisms and viruses, it is considered a spiritual illness that jeopardizes our good fortune.</p>
<p class="indent">These tendencies are found in a story collected by Ibie that speaks of how <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n, <span class="small">&#7884;</span>bal<span class="small">&#250;</span>way<span class="small">&#233;</span>, <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> and Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>kun came to earth in pursuit of wealth. They invited <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> to take part in this expedition, but he declined and told them that he preferred wealth to find him. These <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> went to earth and started to dig for treasure. <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n had brought all the necessary tools, and was the first to dig. He dug deep, and at some point the earth covered him in an avalanche of soil, and he was rejected from the earth with four cowries placed on his chest. <span class="small">&#7884;</span>bal<span class="small">&#250;</span>way<span class="small">&#233;</span> went after <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n and started to dig, but as he got too deep, an avalanche of earth covered him and the earth rejected him with sixteen cowries on his chest. The same fate befell <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> and Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>kun. All around the corpses were heaps of treasure and the cowries that they had dug up. Noticing that the <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> were late returning, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> asked If<span class="small">&#225;</span> what was going on and was told to make sacrifice of two ladders and some other things. He climbed down to earth on the ladders and saw his dead friends and the heaps of treasure and money, which he brought back to <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run. He gave to the family of each of the deceased <a id="page_339"></a>compensation in conformity with the cowries on their chest and he himself became a rich man. Hence, this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> is also known as <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span>g<span class="small">&#249;</span>n</i>, which is a term describing the use of excess of strength in the pursuit of what is beautiful; in this case wealth. This form of greed tends to bring out what is treacherous in people, a dark ambition that makes us exclude and hurt others so we can enjoy an abundance that is not always our own. Ibie (1986:236) summarizes well the essential message in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>:</p>
