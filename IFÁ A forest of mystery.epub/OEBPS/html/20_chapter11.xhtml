It also speaks of the delicate balance between the ruler of a kingdom and the population. It is an <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> of immense prosperity and wealth, both material and intellectual. We find the umbilical cord and the hangman<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s noose here, symbols that bind destiny with both grace and disgrace. One proverb from <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> says: <span class="small">&#8216;</span>Disgrace (<i>k<span class="small">&#224;</span>s<span class="small">&#224;</span>k<span class="small">&#224;</span>s<span class="small">&#224;</span></i>) is the father of success (<i>k<span class="small">&#233;</span>sek<span class="small">&#233;</span>se</i>),<span class="small">&#8217;</span> meaning that our early failures should teach us wisdom so that we can understand the path to success.

<p class="indent">From <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> onwards, we find a subtle meta-mathematic, a particular dynamic of reverse reflexes is played out from here until the last <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i>. The <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span>s</i> pair up in a mutually reflective way. In the case of <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i>, its reverse reflex is the following <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>k<span class="small">&#224;</span>nr<span class="small">&#224;</span>n m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i>, and the same applies to <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>k<span class="small">&#224;</span>nr<span class="small">&#224;</span>n m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> in relation to <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i>. This means that <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>k<span class="small">&#224;</span>nr<span class="small">&#224;</span>n m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> holds the remedy to what might be problematic in <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> and vice versa. The next four pairs of <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> have a similar relationship; it is in <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> that we find the keys and clues to this relationship between the remaining <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span>s</i> in the many proverbs relating how one needs the other, and how we cannot accomplish our destiny in solitude. We must embrace other travellers on our journey, and this journey comes with the potential for disgrace as much as for success. The importance of interdependency for achieving success is emphasized in the following stanza:</p>

<p class="indent">This verse speaks of <i>ondero</i>, a bird that prefers to stay on the ground despite being able to fly. It abandons its eggs to be hatched by the sun or volcanic heat. The young birds fly immediately after hatching, and are left to defend themselves against snakes and predators as best they can. This bird symbolizes the individual stepping into the world. It is a symbol of one hand helping the other, as air and earth help this bird to find itself, support it and challenge it. The verse speaks of a perfect order and balance, and the serenity and wisdom necessary for discernment.</p>
<p class="indent">The sacrifice consists of a sheep, a pigeon and coral beads. In If<span class="small">&#225;</span> doctrine, the sheep represents our connection with ancestry and is usually given when we seek to ward off death. The pigeon represents the power of loyalty, long life and creativity, whilst the coral beads represent royal achievements and glory. The <i>aw<span class="small">&#249;</span>n</i> tree was told to use these to clean the consciousness (or head) of a bird who lives simultaneously in two habitats, earth and air. <i>Aw<span class="small">&#249;</span>n</i> is an ambiguous spirit, being considered both a <span class="small">&#8216;</span>devil tree<span class="small">&#8217;</span> and a <span class="small">&#8216;</span>god tree.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> He represents someone who already possessed a double or divided consciousness, and so was ideally positioned to solve a similar issue for another. <i>Aw<span class="small">&#249;</span>n</i> is an impressive tree that can grow as tall as 60 metres and possesses great medicinal properties. The bark can be used to make a tincture that expels the afterbirth, but its most impressive property is as an antidote to poisoning by snake, scorpion and rat. By extension it can be used as a treatment for most microbial venereal infections and also malaria. It has recently been discovered that it contains large amounts of anti-HIV antibodies.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_203"></a>In <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span></i>, the royal palm (<i>Ceiba sp</i>.) came to Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span> with his sisters, Frog and Coconut Palm. Like the royal palm, both Frog and Coconut Palm made sacrifice in order to be fertile and prosperous.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> brought prosperity to the world, but people<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s envy, jealousy and bad manners surfaced with it, because it challenged poverty, teaching that no one was destined to be poor in means, spirit or in resources. Each of us can pursue a road to wealth by understanding our qualities. <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span></i> gave the world the fire that enables us to set goals and pursue them, which for many is a provocation, as people tend to choose suffering in preference to pursuing unpredictable possibilities. <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i>, more than any other <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, admonishes us to make our lives better, so we can make other people<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s lives better. Shared prosperity will accumulate just as much as shared suffering.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="small">&#204;</span>y<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>r<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>, who is born in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, is one of the enchanted children of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> activated through the recital of the divinatory chant known as <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>y<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>r<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i>. These enchantments are <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> If<span class="small">&#225;</span> poetry sung in a specific metre sacred to If<span class="small">&#225;</span>, which enables specific <i><span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> to be activated. <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>y<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>r<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i> is similar to <i><span class="small">&#7885;</span>f<span class="small">&#x025A;</span></i> and <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>g<span class="small">&#232;</span>d<span class="small">&#232;</span></i>, which are rhythmic chants following specific tonal structures with the purpose of activating <i><span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#7865;</span></i>, often with dramatic and instantaneous effects. <i><span class="small">&#7884;</span>f<span class="small">&#x025A;</span></i> is used to activate plant genii, medicine and can be used as a vehicle for enabling all forms of possession. We might loosely refer to these tonal poetic songs as invocation. As such the function is different to that which we find with <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span>k<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> (praise chants) and <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>d<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span></i> (prayers), which are used in homage and supplication to spirit.</p>
<p class="indent">This <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> speaks much about <span class="small">&#7884;</span>l<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>f<span class="small">&#237;</span>n, commonly understood to be an epithet of Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span>, like <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>l<span class="small">&#x0276;</span>d<span class="small">&#224;</span>a</i> (the force that creates/generates) and <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i> (the consciousness of all parts). This subject is quite complex, and it is important to gain an understanding of it when we seek to comprehend the mysterious energy of <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i>. <span class="small">&#7884;</span>l<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>f<span class="small">&#237;</span>n is commonly considered to be associated with the sun and to represent the concept of divine law, and, through this, it is intimately related to Od<span class="small">&#249;</span>duw<span class="small">&#224;</span> as well. Some traditions see <span class="small">&#7884;</span>l<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>f<span class="small">&#237;</span>n as a form of Od<span class="small">&#249;</span>duw<span class="small">&#224;</span>. In the force needed to generate creation, and the shards of consciousness needed to generate an intelligible and ensouled creation, we find the principle of divine law. The idea of divine law in If<span class="small">&#225;</span> is similar to that which we find in the concepts of <i>dharma</i> and <i>rta</i>, the forces that uphold cosmic order. Indeed, the following passage from <i>Rigveda</i> speaks of this: <span class="small">&#8216;</span>O Indra, lead us on the path of <i>Rta</i>, on the right path over all evils.<span class="small">&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_204"></a>Indra has similar traits to those of <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span>, who came to power in this <i>od<span class="small">&#250;</span></i>. Indra was a leader of gods/devas, and he possessed the powers of the thunder. He rode on a white elephant and was the brother of Agni, the fire. As Vajrapani, Indra was appointed to be the one who should guard the dharma, in spite of his tendencies towards womanizing and drunken and aggressive behaviour. In this image, we recognise <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span>, a prominent military leader who enforces justice by the use of thunder and fire. <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> is always called to stand close to <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span>, whose animal is the elephant, so that his military and royal power can be ruled by a wise and tempered consciousness, rather than the fiery ways to which he is more prone. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> conferred immense amounts of power and knowledge upon <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span>. However, it is the <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> which enforces divine law, as we see in one of the praise names of <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> associated with it <span class="small">&#8211;</span> <i><span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> <span class="small">&#7884;</span>l<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>f<span class="small">&#237;</span>n <span class="small">&#224;</span>p<span class="small">&#232;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span> l<span class="small">&#250;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span></i> <span class="small">&#8211;</span> translated as <span class="small">&#8216;</span> <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> is the one who enforces the law.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> This means that deviations from the cosmic laws established by <span class="small">&#7884;</span>l<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>f<span class="small">&#237;</span>n provoke a confrontation with <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>, as he is the spirit set to enforce and guard the cosmic possibilities and ensure that their unfolding is in conformity with what the cosmic law permits.</p>
<p class="indent">If<span class="small">&#225;</span> is adamant about the rich possibilities within the cosmic order and encodes them in the 256 <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span>s</i>, representing the cosmic matrix and helix. When we speak of cosmic law and concepts such as dharma, we need to recognize that If<span class="small">&#225;</span> is preoccupied with living our life so that we can experience ultimate fulfilment and happiness. It follows that we are born with a given constitution that leads to some courses of action bringing fortune to us, and others misfortune. We are reminded to act in conformity with this constitution and not to defy it. Doing this, we notice that when we make our destiny and walk the world with measured and gentle steps, our good fortune will tend to spill over and bless others as a consequence. Hence If<span class="small">&#225;</span> tells us that <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s name in heaven, which represents a perfection of this energy, is <span class="small">&#8216;</span>He who sits quiet and does not commit offence.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> came to the world to show us that material wealth depends upon the efforts of the person in question. He came as a force to fight poverty by making us realize that worth does not lie in the material world, but in the effort and thought behind it. This action of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> stirred up the resistance of Ik<span class="small">&#250;</span> (Death), who plotted to kill whoever was bringing prosperity to the world. He was not aware of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s identity but, knowing that whoever had angered him was a skilled <i>awo</i>, he arranged for a trial of the most prominent diviners in heaven, in which death would come to whoever failed the test. He sent out a message to the <a id="page_205"></a><i>awos</i>, one after another, concerning a horrible illness which had affected him and which no one seemed able to cure, and he invited them to heal him within seven days. But there was nothing wrong with Ik<span class="small">&#250;</span>, he had deceptively dressed up in the clothes of his wife <span class="small">&#192;</span>r<span class="small">&#249;</span>n, the spirit of illness. He gave the <i>awos</i> kola nuts and wine, which were in reality eggs and sheep<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s urine, as part of the trial. Those who failed to recognize the true identity of these substances had violated taboo, and were consequently sent to Ik<span class="small">&#250;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s prison: it wasn<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t too long before he had a fine gathering of diviners there.</p>
<p class="indent">When the invitation came to <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span>, he immediately went to his diviner for advice. His diviner said that he should offer a goat to his <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> and another goat to <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> and give each of these <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>s</i> a ladder. He was told to wear his <i>id<span class="small">&#233;</span></i>, an enchanted necklace. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> did as instructed and went to Ik<span class="small">&#250;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s palace, where he found the king of Death on his throne, reeking and in a horrible state. Ik<span class="small">&#250;</span> invited him to have some wine and kola nuts. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> sang an enchantment over them to affirm that they were really what they seemed. As he did so, the putrid smell of urine rose from the calabash, and the kola nuts turned into eggs. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> became upset and told Ik<span class="small">&#250;</span> that he would not put up with this sorry excuse for hospitality. Ik<span class="small">&#250;</span> apologized for the incident and pleaded with him to stay, as he was truly in need of his healing. Ik<span class="small">&#250;</span> brought true wine and good kola nuts to him and served him generous portions of food. As <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> was sitting there eating and drinking, <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> came to him. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> shared his food with <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>, who told him to continue with the healing of Ik<span class="small">&#250;</span>, and to agree to whatever terms Ik<span class="small">&#250;</span> might offer. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> did as advised, and embarked upon his seven day attempt to cure Ik<span class="small">&#250;</span>. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> made many medicines, magical soaps and charms for Ik<span class="small">&#250;</span>, but Ik<span class="small">&#250;</span> didn<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t take any of them, and appeared to become worse each day. <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> had however climbed to Ik<span class="small">&#250;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s bedroom with a ladder, from which he could see that he removed the dress of illness every night, and was in fact remarkably healthy. On the sixth day, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> became upset, as Ik<span class="small">&#250;</span> was looking even more sick than ever, but that night <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> came to <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span>, and told him that he should climb the ladder which he had placed outside Ik<span class="small">&#250;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s bedroom. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> did so, and saw that Ik<span class="small">&#250;</span> was healthy and possessed of great vigour. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> became furious, but <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> told him to take the clay gourd from the side of Ik<span class="small">&#250;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s bed, because it contained the vestment of his illness. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> did this and went to sleep, so that he could be well rested before the fatal seventh day. Ik<span class="small">&#250;</span> woke the next morning and reached out for his garment of illness, but could not find it. He looked everywhere in desperation, but had to conclude <a id="page_206"></a>that someone had stolen it. Meanwhile a great crowd of people had gatherered in his palace awaiting the result of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s medicines, but Ik<span class="small">&#250;</span> was reluctant to show himself. It was only when <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> went to his bedroom and threatened to bring him out that he emerged and took to his throne. He was very, very healthy, and acknowledged <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> to be the conqueror of his illness and rewarded him with great amounts of precious stones and jewellery, kola nuts and many other things. On his way back home, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> encountered <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> yet again and shared his newfound wealth abundantly with him, and gave him another goat in gratitude for helping him with this most delicate situation.</p>
<p class="indent">Another story telling of the presence of death, dread and terror concerns the hoopoe (<i><span class="small">&#224;</span>gb<span class="small">&#236;</span>gb<span class="small">&#242;</span>n<span class="small">&#236;</span>w<span class="small">&#x025A;</span>nr<span class="small">&#224;</span>n</i>), who was famous for bringing loss and disaster to households. Hoopoe would take his coffin and place it in front of the door of the house he sought to destroy. Calamity would affect the household, and the death of the owner of the house would follow. After ruining several households, he felt that it was time to target <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>, but before setting off with his coffin he decided to make a divination. The <i>awo</i> told him that he should abandon his plans, because his wicked desires would undoubtedly rebound on him as a curse. The awo told him that he needed to make <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span></i> to <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> with a he-goat and money to avoid disaster befalling him. Hoopoe ignored the advice and decided instead to plan his attack on <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> more carefully. Whilst Hoopoe was contemplating the best moment to bring his coffin to his victim<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s door, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> was visited by bad dreams of death and agitation, and when he awoke he rushed to his <i>awo</i> for a divination. It so happened that his <i>awo</i> was the same one that Hoopoe had been consulting. The <i>awo</i> could tell that the dreams were true, that his life was in danger and the stability of his household threatened. The <i>awo</i> gave him a description of his enemy, without revealing his identity, and told him to make <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span></i> with a goat and some money. He advised him to be careful of people who protended to be his friends. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> made the sacrifice, and in the night he had the same dreams. He awoke, and knew that something wicked was on its way to his door, so he sat down in his gateway awaiting the destroyer. Sure enough, in the darkest hours of the night, Hoopoe flew to <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s house, and landed in front of him. Hoopoe told <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> that he had brought him a gift, and asked his permission to set down the coffin. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> denied him permission with powerful words and incantations. But Hoopoe insisted that he should have it anyway, so he tried with force to lift the coffin off his head, but was not able to <a id="page_207"></a>do so. The coffin had become stuck there, and his wicked adventures came to an end, along with his reputation. This is one of many stories speaking of the importance of dream and it was in <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> that dreams came into the world, as did clairvoyance and second sight.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span></i> is the <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> in which the atmosphere was created. The atmosphere is known as <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>y<span class="small">&#236;</span> oj<span class="small">&#250;</span>-<span class="small">&#225;</span>y<span class="small">&#233;</span></i>, a dense substance composed of gasses that generates vertigo which is understood to be enclosed by a membrane that serves as a covering and container; the <i>igb<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>, if you will, of the unfolding of the spirit of earth. Atmosphere is the vehicle that enables powers, spirits and prayers to move around, hence <span class="small">&#8216;</span>vertigo<span class="small">&#8217;</span> is here synonymous with spiritual atmospheric activity. The <i>ajog<span class="small">&#250;</span>ns</i> are among the powers associated with this. In the following story these hostile forces are tied to the faculty of dreaming</p>
<p class="indent">If<span class="small">&#225;</span> tells of a time when three ajog<span class="small">&#250;</span>ns were wrecking havoc in all Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span> cities and inflicting them with illness, loss, despair and many other negative conditions. These <i>ajog<span class="small">&#250;</span>ns</i> were sent in the form of a he-goat, snake and a pigeon by the king of witches in <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run. Their prime target was <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span>, but first they made a trail of terror in order to reach him. When they were about to reach his city, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> experienced dreams warning him of death and danger. He made a divination, and If<span class="small">&#225;</span> told him to make a sacrifice of a rooster, a rabbit and mashed yam and to give a he-goat to <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> did as instructed, and when he had prepared the sacrifice and gone to leave it in the designated places, <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> went to the <i>ajog<span class="small">&#250;</span>ns</i> and told them that <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> was outside, and that this was their chance to get him. As the three spirits made ready to confront <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span>, <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> went to him, as he was in the process of offering up prayers over the sacrifices at a junction in the road, and told him that he should get going because evil was on the way. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> immediately got up and went to his house. Soon after, the three spirits came to the junction and met <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> there, who told them that <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> had run away like a coward before he had offered up the sacrifice to the <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#7865;</span>s</i> and invited them to eat. The three <i>ajog<span class="small">&#250;</span>ns</i> accepted the invitation, unaware that what they were eating was taboo, and thus they were slowly poisoned. When they had finished eating, they asked <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> where the house of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> was and <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> pointed them in the direction. They went on their way, full of determination, but became more and more ill until they fell dead in front of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s house. When he saw this, he sent a message to all the kings in Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span>land that the threat was over, and he was rewarded handsomely in return by all sixteen kings.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_208"></a>This is a key story in <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span></i>, because it ties in the main factors which made <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> become an example of how the powers of <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span></i> can influence a person for good or ill. It so happened that <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> was very gifted: he could predict events, and because of this he managed to take advantage of situations and became a much respected man. But he had one weakness, alcohol. When he drank, the spirit of boastful self glorification entered him and he revealed his friends<span class="small">&#8217;</span> secrets to anyone who would listen. A sure way to popularity and also to disgrace. This <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> reminds us over and over again of how important it is that someone destined to become a king should always placate his or her <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> and stay away from confusion and trouble. As the proverb says: <span class="small">&#8216;</span>The fly that keeps itself high up in the air will not be caught by traps on the ground.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span></i>, being so full of wealth and movement, can easily lead to confusion, and the proverb given above is usually followed by another that says: <span class="small">&#8216;</span>A fly who knows no greed will never die in a calabash of wine.<span class="small">&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span></i> is closely associated with Eg<span class="small">&#250;</span>ng<span class="small">&#250;</span>n and <span class="small">&#7864;</span>gb<span class="small">&#x00eb;</span>, and because of this the banana palm is important in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. The banana palm is a symbol of long life, a tree ascribed with the knowledge of the visible and invisible realm and of how human beings move from one realm to the other.

<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span></i> introduces the restless desire to acrue wealth and fame in the world, but this urge is accompanied by the need for patience. This theme is encountered <a id="page_209"></a>in a story which tells how <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> was respected as a diviner in the court of <span class="small">&#7884;</span>l<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>f<span class="small">&#237;</span>n, although this never took the form of any significant financial reward. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> did what he was asked by the king, no matter how meagre the reward, in the knowledge that he was destined to be wealthy. He was sure that doing the right thing would eventually reap its rewards. His wife, however, was not happy with the situation, and constantly harassed him over the modest condition of their lives and their lack of progress. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> tried to reason with her, but her impatience just became more feverish. In spite of the erratic restlessness in his home, he diligently studied If<span class="small">&#225;</span>, and went every fourth day to the court of <span class="small">&#7884;</span>l<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>f<span class="small">&#237;</span>n to perform divinations for him. One day, <span class="small">&#7884;</span>l<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>f<span class="small">&#237;</span>n decided to give <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> a reward. He presented him with four giant pumpkins and a trolley to carry them on. The pumpkins were enormous and insanely heavy, and they were not what <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> wanted. Yet in spite of this, they were a gift from his king and food for his household. He came home late that day because of his heavy load, and found his wife standing in the doorway of their simple abode, cursing him from afar. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> entered his house gently with the four giant pumpkins and made a happy face, saying, <span class="small">&#8216;</span>Look, what an abundance of food we received today,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> but his wife was not interested in the pumpkins, and started to berate him with an intensity he had never experienced before. He tried to reason with her, but it was of no use. At last she calmed down, and in the state of peace and tranquillity, which was perhaps mere exhaustion after harassing him for hours, he asked her if she could go to the kitchen to prepare one of the pumpkins so that they could eat. She flew into a rage at this, and told him that she would not prepare any of those pumpkins and that he could go to the kitchen to make food himself if he wanted to eat that useless gift. Discouraged and hungry, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> went to the kitchen and took one of the pumpkins and cut it open, and from it there came a flow of jewellery, money and costly things. Astonished, he took the second pumpkin and cut that open, and the same thing happened. It turned out that <span class="small">&#7884;</span>l<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>f<span class="small">&#237;</span>n had filled up all four of the giant pumpkins with all the valuables and money he could fit into them. This made <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> a rich man, in both wisdom and wealth.</p>
<p class="indent">It follows that the pumpkin is particularly sacred to <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span></i>; it represents peace, patience, comfort and progress. This story is about giving value to everything. It carries a message about blessings, and how they can come from things that we find insignificant, and do not give much value to. As such, it is a call to be appreciative of everything, because fortune moves in mysterious ways. In a commentary <a id="page_210"></a>on this story, P<span class="small">&#243;</span>p<span class="small">&#243;</span><span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> (2008) speaks about the attitude of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> contained in the idea of <i>ad<span class="small">&#236;</span>b<span class="small">&#242;</span></i>, which we can translate as <span class="small">&#8216;</span>covering one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s strength,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> or possessing a power that is not necessarily used. In spite of the torments <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s wife subjected him to, he never became aggravated with her. He tried to reason with her, but he never used force to bring an end to her complaining, cursing and accusations. <i>Ad<span class="small">&#236;</span>b<span class="small">&#242;</span></i> references the Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span> proverb: <span class="small">&#8216;</span>A house without a wife is not a home.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> <i>Ad<span class="small">&#236;</span>b<span class="small">&#242;</span></i> is a word of restraint and patience, of holding back passion in favour of acceptance of one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s condition, not allowing it to colour you black with grief or red with anger but rather white with understanding. <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span></i> tells us that for the wise one, no wife is problematic, it inspires one to understand the outcome of the friction between a calm male and an agitated female, and how this can lead to failure or success. <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span></i> represents the idea of choice that is balanced between self doubt that masks itself as arrogance and self certainty that needs no mask.</p>
<p class="indent">In some versions of this story, the wife of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> realizes her irrational ways, and in others she leaves him in shame, whereupon he takes a new wife who supports him in his ebbing and flowing, but constantly comfortable, situation. These variations need to be interpreted symbolically, because in relation to <span class="small">&#8216;</span>home<span class="small">&#8217;</span> and <span class="small">&#8216;</span>wealth<span class="small">&#8217;</span> we also find the spirit of <i>er<span class="small">&#237;</span>wo</i>, which is literally the filth that generates blockages and is expelled by the body. Our clinging to the filth of error, our desire to hold onto our failures, our urge to make our trespasses a part of our personality, all form part of this concept. For the Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span> people, this term is a vernacular way of speaking about the assumption that the result of a bad action has not been caused by your personality, but rather by a situation that plays itself out. Your involvement in the failure is related to an inability to recognize the filth you have expelled from your life as somehow being related to you.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Er<span class="small">&#237;</span>wo</i> is explained as residing in a hunger or thirst: a thirst and hunger for being more than you are, an appetite which makes everything dry, like the dead skin cells that your body constantly sheds. We are in a state of constant renewal, and need to accept our mistakes in order to avoid greed. We should expel what does not pertain to our own person and path and acquire a more precise focus. We need to give up the <span class="small">&#8216;</span>dross<span class="small">&#8217;</span> even if it has value, because what is worthless for you might be your friend<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s road to success and vice versa. This is why <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> is the spirit that possesses the concept of <i>er<span class="small">&#237;</span>wo</i>. It is as much about one man<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s poison being another man<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s remedy, as it is about acknowledging that my road to fulfilment is not yours, even if our tracks might occasionally cross.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_213"></a>The Western world assumes, if not demands, that if you are rich in the realm of matter, you should be poor in the domain of spirit. <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span></i> says that you can have both, but in a way that is appropriate for you. It reminds us that if one person speaks well of you, you may be sure that there will be two others who mutter envious curses. People do not like to see others outshining them, and it is in this realization that we make a knot in our own web of fortune and misfortune, each according to their cunning, as masters and mistresses of our fate.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span></i> speaks of the community<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s responsibility to set an example for the next generation. A Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span> proverb tells: <span class="small">&#8216;</span>It is when the <i>ir<span class="small">&#243;</span>k<span class="small">&#242;</span></i> tree is young that we should prune its branches,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> a reference to being diligent in the education of the coming generation. This is only worthwhile if the educators are conscientious in the example which they present.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span></i> is concerned with politics, and is the <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> that incarnated <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> as a chief. In the records of the historical <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span>, the <i>al<span class="small">&#225;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>fin</i> of <span class="small">&#7884;</span>y<span class="small">&#7885;</span> state, we find a great general with brilliant tactics, a man given to fascination with sorcery, and possessed of great appetites for women, food and beauty. Here is the immense prosperity which <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span></i> brought to the world. With the success of <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> came hubris. The force that gives birth to a Julius Caesar can also produce paranoid and despotic tyrants, such as Idi Amin. In the case of <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span>, one of his last noted feats was the execution of one of his many wives who he, as judge and jury, found guilty of infidelity. The verdict was also executed by him alone, a demonstration of ruthless power and total solipsism. He took the convicted wife to the centre of the market, tore out her heart with his bare hands and consumed it. Shortly afterwards, he was himself judged by his <i><span class="small">&#7884;</span>gb<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>nis</i> and <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>y<span class="small">&#224;</span>m<span class="small">&#237;</span>s</i> and was commanded to commit suicide. <i><span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span></i> fled into exile, and only <span class="small">&#7884;</span>ya followed him to the gallows from which he returned to <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run. His ritual suicide, which is the way to remove a bad king in Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span> society, took place in the <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span> <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>k<span class="small">&#224;</span>nr<span class="small">&#224;</span>n</i>, which follows <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span></i>, but all the choices leading to his end were generated in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. Prior to his demise, we find that <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span>, through hard words and even harsher judgments, ensured his father<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s suicide and his mother<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s near suicide, when he wrongly accused her of being a slut, which she turned into a <span class="small">&#8216;</span>curse of the mothers<span class="small">&#8217;</span> upon him. This <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> generates greatness, and greatness requires a calm and contemplative consciousness. Hence, one Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span> proverb states that <a id="page_214"></a><span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> without <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> begets tyranny. This idea is also found in the earth sign of <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span></i>, which begins with the influence of <i><span class="small">&#200;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span> Ogb<span class="small">&#232;</span></i> in the first single lines, which calls upon accumulation in the three lines that follow.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span></i> holds the power which enables us to use everything at hand to our advantage, and as a means of generating wealth. It comes with the accompaniment of backbiting, slander and enmity, and holds out a constant invitation to participate in this negative energy, which leads one to lose prosperity for the sake of arrogance and rash choices. <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span></i> counsels thinking before taking action: <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> needs <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> as <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span></i> needs <i><span class="small">&#200;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span> Ogb<span class="small">&#232;</span></i>. In this we find the formula for ideal political power in If<span class="small">&#225;</span> and Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span> society. It is necessary to possess the power to spread abundance and prosperity, but to balance this with an acceptance of all things. This calls upon generosity, and a recognition that a community is more than one person. A balance must be found between one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s personal needs and the good of the community. This larger perspective finds its microcosmic reflex in the individual balancing his or her own needs and the desire to be loved by the world.</p>
