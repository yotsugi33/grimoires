<p class="indent">It is with patience that we shall accomplish all our goals, hence the snail, boa constrictor, chameleon and elephant are the animals associated with this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. These animals are given to <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span>, who manifests the dynamics in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> in a more tangible form. The elephant represents <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> because of its associations with memory, nobility and kindness. In several parts of Africa we find the belief that the elephant is considered the manifestation of chieftaincy. Legends <a id="page_114"></a>involving the elephant always place him as judge or chief, due to the great wisdom ascribed to him because of his old age.</p>
<p class="indent">The snail represents the quality of <i>tut<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, to be calm and at peace. Their blood is used to appease and calm aggressive forces. The snail also symbolizes patience. It is <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s favourite food. One story in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> speaks of how the snail walked the world in search of a good priest to help her out. This journey was riddled with disappointments, but she did not give up, and finally met a priest who possessed good character and was able to help with her a<span class="small">&#64260;</span>ictions.</p>
<p class="indent">The boa constrictor is another of the animals of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span>. It shares his secretive and nocturnal habits, and the white skin it sheds is said to be the cloth of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span>. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> is a solitary spirit with a fondness for the forest clad mountains and thus shares an a<span class="small">&#64259;</span>nity with this snake which prefers solitude in the treetops or thicket.</p>
<p class="indent">The chameleon became associated with <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> because of its gentle way of walking in the world, and its ability to see everything from one point and to become one with whatever landscape it found itself in. However, it is not strictly <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s animal, but primarily <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s. Like the boa, it is an animal which they share. Both represent the protective forces of these two deities, and it is upon the energy of these two animals that they base their protection.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Funfun</i> (whiteness) is born in <i><span class="small">&#200;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span> Ogb<span class="small">&#232;</span></i>. Whiteness possesses a number of qualities associated with wisdom and <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>w<span class="small">&#224;</span> rere</i> (a calm, good and joyful character). Whiteness is signified by maturity, clarity of mind and the power of dream. Dream is the prima materia used by the divine artisans to bring about manifestation. <span class="small">&#210;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#193;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span>se is one of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s praise names and it means <span class="small">&#8216;</span>spirit who holds the power of dreams,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> a play on words between <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span></i> and <i><span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>, the former signifying <span class="small">&#8216;</span>the spirit of whiteness and purity<span class="small">&#8217;</span> and the latter <span class="small">&#8216;</span>the power of dream<span class="small">&#8217;</span> as symbolized by his white cloth.</p>
<p class="indent">In <i><span class="small">&#200;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span> Ogb<span class="small">&#232;</span></i>, we find such <i>im<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>l<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>s</i> as Iyem<span class="small">&#242;</span><span class="small">&#243;</span> and <span class="small">&#192;</span>y<span class="small">&#224;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> as powers that aid the process of bringing light into matter, using dream as a vehicle of transformation. If<span class="small">&#225;</span> places great emphasis on dream, as it is the beginning of manifestation. Iyem<span class="small">&#242;</span><span class="small">&#243;</span> is also known as <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span> funfun</i> which is understood to be a benevolent but mysterious force that holds the power of shaping dreams and nightmares. Iyem<span class="small">&#242;</span><span class="small">&#243;</span> is said to be the wife of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> in some traditions. Her name means <span class="small">&#8216;</span>mother of my hands<span class="small">&#8217;</span> and this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> relates how the hands and the feet (<span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span>) need to work in harmony.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_115"></a><i><span class="small">&#200;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span> Ogb<span class="small">&#232;</span></i> tells that in the beginning all creatures were without <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i>, they were without heads (that is, consciousness). <span class="small">&#192;</span>y<span class="small">&#224;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span>, the divine sculptor of consciousness, is described as a drunkard, though one possessed of amazing artistic skills. He has the gift of molding wonderful consciousnesses, but all too often they turn out flawed due to his intoxication and his getting too creative with his work! If<span class="small">&#225;</span> tells us that we all need to go to his house to select our or<span class="small">&#237;</span> before departing for earth, but since he is such a great artisan the imperfections encoded in the various heads we can choose are not evident, so many of us end up with an impaired consciousness. In the house of <span class="small">&#192;</span>y<span class="small">&#224;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span>, at the moment we elect our <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> and set our destiny, the owner of heaven, whom we also call God, says, <span class="small">&#8216;</span>May you reap blessings on your journey.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> There is no judgment to be found in selecting a good or an impaired <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i>, it just places us on different paths, with heavier or lighter challenges.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> is a fundamental concept for understanding If<span class="small">&#225;</span> and <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> is born in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. The word <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> has different levels of meaning, but it can be translated as <span class="small">&#8216;</span>to receive one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s self,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> from <i>o</i> signifying <span class="small">&#8216;</span>someone<span class="small">&#8217;</span> and <i>r<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> denoting <span class="small">&#8216;</span>to receive.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> <i>Or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> can also mean <span class="small">&#8216;</span>head<span class="small">&#8217;</span> or <span class="small">&#8216;</span>summit,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> such as the mountain, the dwelling of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">One is confronted with a way of using the words that indicates that the symbol and what it symbolizes are one and the same, and that the meaning in turn depends upon context. <i>Or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> is the physical head, both what it contains and the spiritual qualities associated with it. First and foremost of these is consciousness. Without <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> nothing can be accomplished, no evolution can be achieved, nor can wisdom be comprehended. This is why we find it as a theme repeated throughout the If<span class="small">&#225;</span> corpus; as an <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>s<span class="small">&#7865;</span> If<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> from Ogb<span class="small">&#232;</span>g<span class="small">&#249;</span>nd<span class="small">&#225;</span> says: <i><span class="small">&#7864;</span>ni t<span class="small">&#8217;</span><span class="small">&#243;</span> gb<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>n. Or<span class="small">&#237;</span> <span class="small">&#x0275;</span> l<span class="small">&#8217;</span><span class="small">&#243;</span> n<span class="small">&#237;</span> <span class="small">&#243;</span> gb<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>n</i>, that is <span class="small">&#8216;</span>He who is wise, is made wise by his or<span class="small">&#237;</span>.<span class="small">&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>The concept of <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> is connected to the idea of our personal daimon or guardian angel. This is because there can be no perception without consciousness. More particularly <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> implies the spiritual foundation of a healthy consciousness. Some say that <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> reveals itself in the <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i> that claims our head, but this requires some clarification. The <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i> that we are initiated to, the one who claims our head, represents a particular cosmic colouring that replicates the essence of <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i>, but <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> is also understood to be its own spiritual category, born from one of the 256 <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span>s</i> in the If<span class="small">&#225;</span> corpus.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> is seen as a gathering of factors with specific denominations. <i>Or<span class="small">&#237;</span> <span class="small">&#242;</span>de</i> signifies the physical head, the material covering of consciousness.<i>Or<span class="small">&#237;</span> in<span class="small">&#250;</span></i> denotes the inner head, consciousness itself, and is seen as having a dual quality known as <i>ap<span class="small">&#225;</span>r<span class="small">&#237;</span></i>, a form of nakedness and openness of what is held and what is expressed. It is here in consciousness laid bare that we find the faculties which produce our character (<i><span class="small">&#236;</span>w<span class="small">&#224;</span></i>). If<span class="small">&#225;</span> sees <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>w<span class="small">&#224;</span></i> as a young and inquisitive female force. The parallels with Psyche and Eros in Plato<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s <i>Timaeus</i> are too close to be ignored. In Plato<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s vision Psyche (Soul) is also seen as a young and curious woman. In meeting with Eros (Love), she experiences growth and in this she finds identity, discovering the silent essence of selfhood. In the context of If<span class="small">&#225;</span> this growth is accomplished by being constantly aware, by approaching the world with loving interest and by being conscientious about discerning the good from the bad. Our bad experiences serve to firm up our integrity and character, they teach us the lessons we need in order to reach the fullness of our potential. It is how we conceive of these challenges that makes the difference, here we find the secret of how to turn vinegar into wine. This idea is intimately connected to a further concept, <i><span class="small">&#232;</span>r<span class="small">&#237;</span> <span class="small">&#7885;</span>k<span class="small">&#224;</span>n</i>, which means <span class="small">&#8216;</span>what the heart bears witness to.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> In other words, consciousness and heart need to be in alignment for one to prosper on one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s chosen path. What makes this alignment possible is the faculty of <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span> <span class="small">&#225;</span>peere</i> that represents the natural connection with <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> possessed by all of us, which invites perfection. So it is by understanding the energetic matrix of creation that we can generate this alignment between consciousness and the heart. This faculty is of an alchemical or transformative nature. It is the faculty that explains difference, as it is seen as being rooted in one of the four elements. The metaphor If<span class="small">&#225;</span> uses is that water is always water, but water from a thunderstorm, water going stale in a well, and water flowing free in a cold river are different, though they share something in common.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_119"></a>If<span class="small">&#225;</span> understands human consciousness as a naked field of consciousness which is attached to an elemental vibration and coloured by one of the 256 <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span>s</i>, which represent the totality of cosmic possibility.</p>
<p class="indent">The idea of the heart is always connected to the idea of love, but also to deception. There is a typical Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span> play on words, where <i><span class="small">&#7885;</span>k<span class="small">&#224;</span>n</i> (heart) is contrasted with <i><span class="small">&#7885;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> (viper), demonstrating the heart<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s unpredictability. If<span class="small">&#225;</span> teaches us deeply about the constitution of consciousness, imparting that the <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> holds the necessary power to enable its perfect alignment with the heart.</p>
<p class="indent">The points of power in our consciousness are known as <i>iw<span class="small">&#225;</span>j<span class="small">&#250;</span> or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i>, <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> and <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>p<span class="small">&#224;</span>k<span class="small">&#242;</span></i>. <i>Iw<span class="small">&#225;</span>j<span class="small">&#250;</span></i> represents <span class="small">&#8216;</span>the third eye,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> our capacity for vision and being receptive to divine inspiration. This is the entrance for prophecy and clarity. <i><span class="small">&#192;</span>t<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> is located at the crown of the skull, and is translated as <span class="small">&#8216;</span>sanctuary<span class="small">&#8217;</span> and <span class="small">&#8216;</span>temple.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> This centre of power is known as <i>l<span class="small">&#225;</span>y<span class="small">&#233;</span>-l<span class="small">&#225;</span>y<span class="small">&#233;</span></i> and signifies a state in which one experiences the source of creation. One<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s being merges with origin outside of the confines of time and space and is considered to be in a state of possession. It is this state which the <i>awo</i> of If<span class="small">&#225;</span> enters during prayers, divinations, and initiations; the state of wakeful dream. It is a mystical state in which the energetic circuit of creation is enfolding the <i>awo</i>, and he or she becomes a manifestation of the beginning of wisdom. <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>p<span class="small">&#224;</span>k<span class="small">&#242;</span></i> is the name given to the point at the nape of the neck where our <span class="small">&#8216;</span>animal<span class="small">&#8217;</span> brain is to be found. It is here that we generate a connection with life and nature. The dead, <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i> and all the spirits of nature speak to us through this gateway. Possession via this point of instinct and arcane memory can be violent at times, and is very different to being possessed by the spirits of dream, as happens when the gate of <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> is used to invite a spirit in.</p>
<p class="indent">The idea of the left and the right are found in <i><span class="small">&#200;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span> Ogb<span class="small">&#232;</span></i>. We lift both our hands to the heavens to receive. The left hand is for defence and the right hand for acceptance. In the stories of creation, spirits of the left are those of fire and restlessness, whilst the spirits of the right are those of benevolence. There is a balance to be found in this play between forces, and which calls upon skill to mediate between them. The hands belong to the body and the head should rule the hands. We need to aspire to become conscious of how we manipulate the forces of the right and the left. Any form of imbalance will throw us off centre.The two hands are represented by <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> holding two horns, one containing <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> (ideas) and the other holding <i><span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> (the power of accomplishment). <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> is the only <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> who possesses both <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> and <i><span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#7865;</span></i>. This balance generates a need for <a id="page_120"></a>otherness, and because of this <i><span class="small">&#200;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span> Ogb<span class="small">&#232;</span></i> speaks repeatedly about the importance of an harmonious gathering of forces. The balance of power can alter, as when a spirit of <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> becomes the wielder of <i><span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> in relation to another force. For instance in the relationship that <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> holds with <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> is the force of <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>, whilst <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> is the <i><span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#7865;</span></i>, the executing force. If we look at the relationship between <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span>ny<span class="small">&#236;</span>n and <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>, we see the power relationship shift, as <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> is the portent of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span>ny<span class="small">&#236;</span>n<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>, being the <i><span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span>ny<span class="small">&#236;</span>n.

<p class="indent"><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> is the <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#237;</span>s<span class="small">&#224;</span></i> most closely associated with <i><span class="small">&#200;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span> Ogb<span class="small">&#232;</span></i> because he understands the balance of the two hands and the importance of conscience. It is not easy to define his origin <span class="small">&#8211;</span> or his gender <span class="small">&#8211;</span> as there are so many traditions. <i><span class="small">&#200;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span> Ogb<span class="small">&#232;</span></i> states that even if he is the youngest <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, he is the one who holds the greatest honour and who is destined to rule the entire retinue of cosmic vibrations.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> belongs to the class of spiritual forces known as <i>funfun</i>, a word meaning <span class="small">&#8216;</span>white.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> The word <i>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i>, from which <i>funfun</i> may have developed, or is at least related to, contains the idea of <span class="small">&#8216;</span>giving,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> <span class="small">&#8216;</span>to impregnate.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> For instance, <i>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n obinrin</i> means to make a woman pregnant. <i>Funfun</i> refers to an ability of whiteness to impregnate matter and references spermatozoa and the mucus membranes.</p>
<p class="indent">The <i>funfun</i> spirits prefer the forest, as many of the praise names for <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> testify. So we find Oluwo Igb<span class="small">&#243;</span>, meaning <span class="small">&#8216;</span>great prophet of the forest,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> <span class="small">&#210;</span><span class="small">&#242;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span> <span class="small">&#204;</span>gbow<span class="small">&#250;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span>n, <span class="small">&#8216;</span>spirit that lives in a faraway forest,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> <span class="small">&#7884;</span>ba Igb<span class="small">&#243;</span>, <span class="small">&#8216;</span>king of the forest,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> and <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#x0276;</span><span class="small">&#232;</span>r<span class="small">&#232;</span>m<span class="small">&#x025A;</span>gb<span class="small">&#242;</span>, <span class="small">&#8216;</span>source of goodness from the forest.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> The importance of the forest is evident in If<span class="small">&#225;</span>; it is where the worlds meet, and it is where we find places which serve as portals between dimensions of being. Hence the forest as a place of power is a reference to the process of initiation, <i>igb<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, and the energetic womb of the forest is the place where we remake ourselves and initiate every new journey.</p>
<p class="indent"><i>Funfun</i> is contrasted to <i>d<span class="small">&#250;</span>d<span class="small">&#250;</span></i>, symbolized by the colour black. <i>D<span class="small">&#250;</span>d<span class="small">&#250;</span></i> is not only the colour, but what is concealed and how it may be revealed. There is a third class of energy, the <i>awo pupa</i> or <span class="small">&#8216;</span>red mysteries,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> which are spiritual forces of the blood, heart, passions, and the possibilities for germination of any sort. The use of <i>awo pupa</i> is a reference to passion and fierceness. In If<span class="small">&#225;</span> metaphysics there are only these three colours, which denote the qualities found in creation as well as the potentialities inherent in <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>The <i>funfun</i> are ancient spirits who were involved in the process of creation. They are the luminosity before the first light, as spoken of in the last of the <i>m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span>s</i>, <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i>, which at times is called <i><span class="small">&#192;</span>gb<span class="small">&#225;</span>baba od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, the grandfather of <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> and the source of light. Here in the dynamic between the first and last <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> is the alpha and the omega, the ouroboros devouring its own tail. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> manifests in the first <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, <i><span class="small">&#200;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span> Ogb<span class="small">&#232;</span></i>, which is the potential for illumination found in the powers held by the <span class="small">&#8216;</span>grandfather,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> <span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n. <i><span class="small">&#200;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span> Ogb<span class="small">&#232;</span></i> manifests this potential for light and illumination. Potential and becoming through the vehicle of dream and imagination are a constant theme in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. The condition of <span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n, pure consciousness, still and un-manifested, can be touched in dreams. If<span class="small">&#225;</span> teaches us that nothing that is not first imagined can become a reality; dream and imagination are the source of becoming. Our good fortune begins in dreams, in the invisible universe of spiritual denizens called <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>m<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>l<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i>, <span class="small">&#8216;</span>house of light.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> These spirits transform spiritual potential into physical reality. Such is the origin of the substance of creation and accomplishment we recognize as <i><span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#7865;</span></i>. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> is the one who brings this light of possibility into the world and therefore his votaries say of him: <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> s<span class="small">&#249;</span>n n<span class="small">&#237;</span>n<span class="small">&#250;</span> <span class="small">&#224;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> j<span class="small">&#237;</span> n<span class="small">&#237;</span>n<span class="small">&#250;</span> <span class="small">&#224;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> tin<span class="small">&#250;</span> <span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> d<span class="small">&#236;</span>de, <span class="small">&#204;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span> <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>, <span class="small">&#8216;</span>The king of the white cloth sleeps in white, the king of the white cloth wakes up in white, the king of the white cloth rises in white.<span class="small">&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="indent">Light is the building block of being and creation. The interaction between light and darkness constitutes the cosmic pulse and is replicated in man by breath. When we inhale and exhale, we move between life and its absence. On a cosmic scale, this takes the form of light and darkness. It is these extremes that generate the stability of the earth, and these contrasts that make our world a mystery. The source of light manifests in several ways and is a source for abundance, blessings, wealth and what the Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span> people call <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span> rere</i>, a calm conscience. Being in the world should be as soothing and comforting as caresses from the rays of the sun. When light is exalted, it burns and makes all things barren. It does this while it remains in the glory of its own being. These cosmic and mystical phenomena can be replicated in people as well, and give what can be understood as a negative vibration of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span>. When light turns negative, it implodes and dislocates our sense of self importance. Our indecisiveness becomes a tool for allowing the scorching sun to burn the fields and people around us. Using the light for personal ends can, in its positive manifestation, lead to natural authority, in its negative manifestation it will generate arrogance. Ultimately <a id="page_122"></a>arrogance will lead to the sense of total supremacy, in which one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s words are experienced as weightier than even the word of Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>d<span class="small">&#249;</span>mar<span class="small">&#232;</span>, the creator. At this point, light will collapse and implode and the bright scorching sun make your spiritual life barren and void of light. In regard to this complex interaction, an If<span class="small">&#225;</span> proverb tells us that <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> needs <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> in order to be a just ruler, as strength without a clear and enlightened mind leads to tyranny. The red powers of strength and the whiteness of light need to be in harmony. But we are not perfect, and at times even the accumulation of wisdom and understanding can ignite the illusion of supremacy within us. When the redness, the enthusiasm of strength, has overcome a person the remedy is calmness. In <i><span class="small">&#200;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span> Ogb<span class="small">&#232;</span></i>, the presence of <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> is symbolized by the thunderstone, which contains his <i><span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#7865;</span></i>. It is, however, made clear that this came from the cone shaped summit of the mountain of the world, and formed the foundation for the rule of the first <i><span class="small">&#7885;</span><span class="small">&#x025A;</span>ni</i> (king) of Il<span class="small">&#233;</span> If<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>. The verse that speaks of the thunderstone establishing kingship on Earth calls upon <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> to counsel the king, in order that gain and abundance be part of the royal rule.</p>
<p class="indent">It is in <i><span class="small">&#200;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span> Ogb<span class="small">&#232;</span></i>that we also find the importance of the chest and genitals. The chest, in which the heart resides, symbolizes our capacity for love and friendship, and the genitals the source of ancestry and continuation of lineage. In this complex of consciousness, love and lineage we find truth. In If<span class="small">&#225;</span>, <i>s<span class="small">&#242;</span>t<span class="small">&#237;</span>t<span class="small">&#242;</span></i> (truth) is considered to be one of the forces that upholds mystery. The other pole is to be righteous, so that truth becomes truly immutable and a silent witness to creation, an observer of the many rays of light. We recognize this in beauty, and when we are touched by beauty, we are touched by truth. This dynamic is expressed in the Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span> proverb that tells us: <span class="small">&#8216;</span>when your life gets better, my life gets better.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> Truth makes a way for truthfulness, but will always remain <i>awo</i> (mystery). Truth is not about facts; it is about the recognition of mystery, a recognition that shakes the bells of truth in our soul.</p>

<p class="indent">In this story we find the origin of the violent temper of <span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#243;</span>k<span class="small">&#243;</span>, and its complicated relationship with children and <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>b<span class="small">&#237;</span>k<span class="small">&#250;</span></i>. If<span class="small">&#225;</span> tells that there are thirty six <i><span class="small">&#225;</span>j<span class="small">&#233;</span></i> living in the branches of <span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#243;</span>k<span class="small">&#242;</span>, many of whom call upon our most vile and destructive passions. We find here the spirits of wasps, of mothers who kill, and of cruelty. Despite <span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#243;</span>k<span class="small">&#242;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s reputation for aggression he is considered to be a wise judge, the first tree spirit to come to earth, a recluse with a unique perspective upon the activities of the world. For the Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span>, <span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#243;</span>k<span class="small">&#242;</span> is the origin of the solution to barrenness, in particular through the cults known as G<span class="small">&#x00eb;</span>l<span class="small">&#x00eb;</span>d<span class="small">&#x00eb;</span> and <span class="small">&#7864;</span>gb<span class="small">&#x00eb;</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">The story that tells of the beginning of the G<span class="small">&#x00eb;</span>l<span class="small">&#x00eb;</span>d<span class="small">&#x00eb;</span> society is as follows. At the beginning of time the first tree that took root in Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span> was <span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#243;</span>k<span class="small">&#242;</span>, and with him came spirits older than time that found solace in his branches. <span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#243;</span>k<span class="small">&#242;</span> loved the night and possessed amazing magical powers which he would sometimes use to spread confusion amongst the humans who had started to appear <span class="small">&#8211;</span> just for his amusement. The hunters gradually recognised his powers and came to him for aid and assistance, and it is from the <span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#243;</span>k<span class="small">&#242;</span> that the hunters were gifted the power of <i><span class="small">&#242;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#242;</span></i>, the capacity of allowing the soul to go out of the body in order to track <a id="page_124"></a>prey. <span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#243;</span>k<span class="small">&#242;</span> became sought after for advice and help with various problems. He just had two rules: no one could look at him directly, and those wanting his help had to give something in return. It so happened that the women in the villages around <span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#243;</span>k<span class="small">&#242;</span> were all barren, and so they went to him to see if he could help them. They formed a ring around <span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#243;</span>k<span class="small">&#242;</span> with their backs turned towards him and petitioned him for children. They promised animals and agricultural gifts in return, but one woman, Ol<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#243;</span>mb<span class="small">&#237;</span>, had nothing to give, so she promised to give him her firstborn. Nine months later, they all gave birth to children and went to pay the agreed offerings, all except for Ol<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#243;</span>mb<span class="small">&#237;</span>. She decided to keep her baby boy at home and avoid any confrontation with <span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#243;</span>k<span class="small">&#242;</span>. Time passed until one day she was on the way to the market when the spirit of <span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#243;</span>k<span class="small">&#242;</span> appeared in front of her, reminding her of her promise. She pleaded and cried, but <span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#243;</span>k<span class="small">&#242;</span> was not interested in excuses or explanations and turned her into a bird, saying, <span class="small">&#8216;</span>So be it, may you then be a prisoner in my branches.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> He took her to live with him forever, and she did indeed stay there for a long time, singing her sorrowful songs. But one day a woodcarver came by and hearing her song understood her plight. He used his skills to make a perfect wooden boy. The wooden doll was sanctified with herbs and perfumes and beautifully dressed. The woodcarver brought the wooden doll to <span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#243;</span>k<span class="small">&#242;</span>, saying that this was the child that he had been promised. <span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#243;</span>k<span class="small">&#242;</span> was so taken in by the beauty of the craftsmanship that he accepted the wooden doll in place of the firstborn of Ol<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#243;</span>mb<span class="small">&#237;</span> and gave her back her human form. In return Ol<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#243;</span>mb<span class="small">&#237;</span> and her family went back to <span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#243;</span>k<span class="small">&#242;</span> with many gifts and offerings and in this way secured his help whenever fertility was a concern.</p>
<p class="indent">Ol<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#243;</span>mb<span class="small">&#237;</span> frequently figures in <i><span class="small">&#200;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span> Ogb<span class="small">&#232;</span></i> as a symbol of ingratitude. Her name means <span class="small">&#8216;</span>She who in her wealth turns fortune into misfortune.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> Several stories use her as an example of someone who has everything but is still not happy, or someone who always wants something more or different to what she has. A story tells of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> approaching her after she has decided to give up on her If<span class="small">&#225;</span> prayers, and wishes her <span class="small">&#8216;</span>good morning.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> She grumbles and murmurs in return, complaining that the wealth she asked for never came. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> rises to the challenge and prepares a medicine that brings wealth to her. She does not respond to this with gratitude or thanks, but with fresh complaints.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="small">&#7864;</span>gb<span class="small">&#x00eb;</span> is a complex mystery in If<span class="small">&#225;</span>. On one hand it speaks of the phenomenon known as <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>b<span class="small">&#237;</span>k<span class="small">&#250;</span></i>, and on the other it refers to mysteries which are taboo. There is a cosmic dimension here that indicates the thin veil between Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span> and <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run. <a id="page_125"></a><span class="small">&#7864;</span>gb<span class="small">&#x00eb;</span> means <span class="small">&#8216;</span>gathering<span class="small">&#8217;</span> or <span class="small">&#8216;</span>society<span class="small">&#8217;</span> and refers to the grouping of spiritual doubles in <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run. When we are born our spiritual double can either release us to experience our journey on earth, or it can summon us back. When this happens, we experience accidents and illness that seek to end our life. This situation is caused because the ties connecting us with our spiritual double are not completely severed after our birth as humans. Such children are called <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>b<span class="small">&#237;</span>k<span class="small">&#250;</span></i> and are recognized, apart from illness and accidents, by sleeping with their eyes open, playing with invisible friends, and many possess clairvoyance and supernatural skills. In order to stay healthy and have a full life span, a pact is made with Ar<span class="small">&#224;</span>gb<span class="small">&#242;</span>, the chief of <span class="small">&#7864;</span>gb<span class="small">&#x00eb;</span>. This involves the construction of a spirit house which is regularly tended in order to secure long life. The <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>b<span class="small">&#237;</span>k<span class="small">&#250;</span></i> phenomenon is also related to twins. A Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span> proverb tells: <i>Ibeji re, omo edun ibeji re, omo edun kerekere-yan</i>, <span class="small">&#8216;</span>Behold twins, children of the monkey, they do not die.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> This mystery belongs to <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span>ny<span class="small">&#236;</span>n, the spirit of herbs, and Eg<span class="small">&#250;</span>ng<span class="small">&#250;</span>n, the collective spirit of ancestral bones, in their capacity of working both sides of the veil. More will be told of these <span class="small">&#8216;</span>bones and arbours of sweetness<span class="small">&#8217;</span> in the chapter on the mysteries of <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>p<span class="small">&#x025A;</span>n m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i>. What is important to note here is <i><span class="small">&#200;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span> Ogb<span class="small">&#232;</span></i> as the beginning of this mystery, which unfolds in a different octave later on in the corpus of If<span class="small">&#225;</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">The greatness accorded to this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> rests in its power of acceptance, the recognition that creation is a structure that is upheld in a dyadic manner. It concerns perceiving the totality, the perspective of the landscape and how the parts make a whole. Hence, in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> we find the image of the sphere, expressed by the calabash, the <i>ob<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> (kola nut), the <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#242;</span>gb<span class="small">&#243;</span></i> (bitter kola nut) and the <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>gb<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>n</i> (coconut).</p>
