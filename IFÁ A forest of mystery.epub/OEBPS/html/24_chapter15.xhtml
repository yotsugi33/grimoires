<p class="chapsub">&#593;e wicked cobra of fire</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_261"></a><i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> means <span class="small">&#8216;</span>wickedness.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> The source of this wickedness can be found in the word <i>ka</i> which signifies a movement that brings together something or someone. Awo Fa<span class="small">&#39;</span>lokun understands this concept to be related to the act of gathering personal power in the use of breath and words. <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> is the power present when we try to make sense of our selves. It is an <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> that speaks of the implications of self affirmation and how this directs accumulated personal power, or <i><span class="small">&#224;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#7865;</span></i>. This power has the potential to be a source of tremendous protection and abundance when directed by a person of good character.</p>
<p class="indent">It was in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> that <span class="small">&#210;</span>k<span class="small">&#232;</span> (mountain) came to earth. Before he set out, he was advised to make sacrifice, as he would surely be surrounded by enemies. He did so, and stood rock solid no matter how much his detractors tried to throw him down. Although <span class="small">&#210;</span>k<span class="small">&#232;</span> came to earth in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, he was really from <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i>, the beginning of light, and represents uprightness, truthfulness and forgiveness as the protection against evil plots.</p>
<p class="indent">This is a complex <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> that speaks of the consequences of being subject to hostility and of how bitterness can fill our heart with vengeance, hatred and mischievousness. <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> speaks about the very premise for the existence of wickedness lieing in a negative use of personal power. This makes us attract a type of spirit known as <i>al<span class="small">&#250;</span>jon<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, meaning <span class="small">&#8216;</span>to beat what is dwelling within,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> whose presence manifests in emotional sickness and the presence of self-generated <span class="small">&#8216;</span>demonic<span class="small">&#8217;</span> forms that encourage hostility. These spirits are attracted by the sensation of fear that compels us to perform wicked acts; acting in this way we invite them into our soul, which they start to torment. Scapegoating and blaming indicates the presence of these ghostly spirits. When someone is deliberately engaging in gossip, cursing and plotting the demise of others, the negative presence of <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> is full blown.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> represents someone who points fingers and toes at others and seeks to harm them. Toes here are a reference to snakes, because it was in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> that snakes acquired fangs filled with venom. The big toe, which is similar in shape to the head of a snake, represents our connection to our ancestors. <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> speaks of lost opportunities, of how the experience of good fortune slipping through one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s fingers starts to feed resentment as a vital part of the gathering of personal power. It is an <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> in which you win the battle but lose the war. We find here (more correctly in <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span>w<span class="small">&#243;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span></i>) the presence of <i>in<span class="small">&#250;</span>k<span class="small">&#242;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i>, the self injurer, he who is crooked within. He is described as someone who throws ashes at other people <a id="page_262"></a>without realizing that he is gradually becoming more and more black through his self hexing. <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> denotes a lack of strategy and lack of horizon. Its energy is of acting on an impulse of unwaranted self protection, perceiving the world as a hostile environment, and yet declaring victory in a war with self in which you defeat yourself and prevent good fortune from entering your life.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> is the <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> in which <span class="small">&#7884;</span>bal<span class="small">&#250;</span>way<span class="small">&#233;</span> brings the hot and fiery winds of disease. It is here that the vengeful aspects of the powers of <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n and <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> are unleashed. It is not an energy dealing with justice, but vengeance and retribution, rooted in a misconceived need to protect one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s soul and self. Many stories tell of how the <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i> expressed this quality, but we always learn that their attitude only led to sorrow and disgrace. <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> is like preparing poison for your enemies <span class="small">&#8211;</span> and friends <span class="small">&#8211;</span> and consuming this poison yourself in an attempt to take down your detractor. <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>w<span class="small">&#224;</span></i> (character) is crucial here, so attention to developing good character and <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> is what balances these forces and brings forth their benign rays.</p>
<p class="indent">Naturally it was in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> that bloodshed, war and warlords came into being; as one verse says: <span class="small">&#8216;</span>Nothing was enough for the world, except for suffering.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> This observation is related to a man called <span class="small">&#7864;</span>l<span class="small">&#630;</span>m<span class="small">&#x025A;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#x0273;</span>, whose name refers to birds dwelling in the <i>os<span class="small">&#232;</span></i> tree (baobab). This person represents the spirit of the warlord, and <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> speaks of how he went for divination. The reason for his request was that he found so much pleasure in war and bloodshed that he wanted to know if he could always delight in it. His <i>awo</i> told him not to worry about this, because the world was so agitated and unruly that only unrest and suffering would satisfy it:</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent"><i>The spirit of the warlord came to If<span class="small">&#225;</span></i></p>

<p class="noindent"><i>War and battles for him to delight in</i></p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_263"></a>Wickedness brings more wickedness and to take delight in it excludes good fortune from your life. This is due to the principle of increase, so prominent in If<span class="small">&#225;</span>; you attract what you are, and the types of energies prominent in your life will multiply. So, the same energy that breeds discord and wickedness is a vibration that increases fear and confusion. In regard to this, Awo P<span class="small">&#243;</span>p<span class="small">&#243;</span><span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> recounts the story of a city known as <span class="small">&#204;</span>kam<span class="small">&#242;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n in the following verse:</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">This city was famous for its wickedness, which was exalted as a virtue even in the names that its inhabitants gave to each other. They were constantly in discord, and had gone from making witty and piquant remarks about one another to elevating offence and provocation into an art form. When <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> came to the city and saw how the people addressed each other, and the cruel and demeaning ways in which they treated one another, he immediately addressed the issue and told them that this was a part of their misfortune. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> went on to the palace of the king and was invited in. He was told that the king was making sacrifice to his <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> and that he should go and find him. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> went through the palace and in the seventeenth room he found the king feeding pangolins (<i>akika</i>) to his <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i>. The king welcomed <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> and asked him to cast If<span class="small">&#225;</span> for him, and If<span class="small">&#225;</span> revealed that wickedness was ruling the city, and that this was caused by the inhabitants<span class="small">&#8217;</span> love of it. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> said that they should immediately cease treating one another in such demeaning and hurtful ways to no longer attract wickedness. The king was told to never feed pangolin to his <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> as this would brew a wicked consciousness. The king did as If<span class="small">&#225;</span> advised and, in turning <a id="page_264"></a>away from wickedness, the people invited sweetness into their city. The king established a cult for <span class="small">&#192;</span>k<span class="small">&#237;</span>k<span class="small">&#233;</span> <span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#7885;</span> gi <span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>, <span class="small">&#8216;</span>the forceful axe that penetrates trees with one blow,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> a praise name for <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">The story is full of deeper meanings, which will be addressed. It speaks of an environment of hostility, where everyone was pointing fingers at everyone else. Sarcasm and cruel jokes were abundant, a situation represented by the king offering pangolin to his <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i>. The pangolin, or scaly anteater, curls itself up into a protective ball when threatened, and is protected from attack by its hardy scales. Feeding pangolin to his consciousness reveals how even the king felt threatened by the climate in his city, that he was constantly seeking to defend himself and develop a thicker skin against the offence given by his citizens. He was carrying out these activities in the seventeenth room, meaning in the house of <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>, utilizing the powers of magic and transformation to protect himself from his own people. This story is contrasted by another which demonstrates how <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> should be treated in relation to the energy of <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>.</p>
<p class="indent">This story tells of a man called Kerenn<span class="small">&#224;</span>s<span class="small">&#236;</span>. He was a careful man, always cautious in his conduct and always mindful of his actions. He stayed away from any form of conflict, confusion and wickedness. He did what he could to ensure that he would live long and peacefully, but he was troubled by witnessing all the worlds turmoil and difficulties. This made him wonder if he would ever manage to not invite wickedness into his life. He went to his <i>awo</i> and asked what he could do to ensure a long, peaceful life. The <i>awo</i> told him that this would be his lot and made 201 ritual incisions (<i>gb<span class="small">&#x0276;</span>r<span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i>) on his head, which he filled with If<span class="small">&#225;</span> medicine. <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> tells us that Kerenn<span class="small">&#224;</span>s<span class="small">&#236;</span> outlived all of his contemporaries. The only sadness he experienced was that of seeing his friends and loved ones grow old and pass away, but his own life was calm and placid until his equally peaceful end. The verse tells that he grew to be 3000 years old. <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> associates him with the <i><span class="small">&#7779;</span>a<span class="small">&#7779;</span>ara</i> (raffia palm) on account of the endurance and strength of its fibres which can be used to make ropes, houses and even bridges. The message is clear, live life in a calm and measured way, in which one is merely a spectator and not a participant in wickedness; this generates a calm space for the <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i>.</p>
<p class="indent">However, this story also places great emphasis on the need to pay attention to one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s consciousness. <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> is clearly an energy which is inclined to generate turbulence for the <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i>. This is demonstrated in the need for Kerenn<span class="small">&#224;</span>s<span class="small">&#236;</span> to receive <a id="page_265"></a>201 incisions on his head, indicative that he was in need of the protection and attention of the 201 <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> to be able to fulfill his goal.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> came to earth with three or<span class="small">&#237;</span>s, or a triple consciousness. One was said to be lodged in the neck and the other two at each shoulder. <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> speaks of this condition as one of instability and a lack of consistency, in which our perception of self and others is distorted. This leads to self deception and disorders of perception typified in the condition we know as schizophrenia. On a cosmic level, <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> represents the <i>ikor<span class="small">&#237;</span>ta meta</i>, the great crossroads where <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run and Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span> meet, the place where <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> dwells, and where we make decisions and choices. Hence fear, indecisiveness and confusion appear to be the negative elements in the presence of choice that spawns wickedness. In short, wickedness is caused by making choices that cause our consciousness to be overcome by negativity.</p>
<p class="indent">Negativity and wickedness is often illustrated by the presence of hair and creeping plants in the corpus of If<span class="small">&#225;</span>. This association is one of several reasons why initiation to <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i> or If<span class="small">&#225;</span> usually calls for the <i>iyawo</i> to give up their hair. It is a symbolic declaration of giving up one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s evil ways. This is further emphasized in how the Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span> people <span class="small">&#8211;</span> and African nations in general <span class="small">&#8211;</span> have an almost intuitive response to treating the hair well and ensure that it is either removed altogether or serves as a decoration for the consciousness, a way of beautifying one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s mind by decorating the <span class="small">&#8216;</span>calabash<span class="small">&#8217;</span> that served as its house. Hair, weeds and creeping plants, in fact anything with the capacity to besiege and dominate a place, belongs to the vibration of <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>. Some of these plants need to be discussed in greater depth.</p>
<p class="indent">Peanuts (<i><span class="small">&#x0275;</span>p<span class="small">&#224;</span></i>) are born in <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>, and are associated with subduing what is good. <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> tells how <span class="small">&#x011a;</span>p<span class="small">&#224;</span> wanted to find a place in which she could reproduce in peace, because wherever she went she was cleared away. She went to her awo, made divination and the necessary sacrifice, and was told that she would indeed take dominion over any place where she decided to settle. Hence one verse in <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> speaks of how she took control of the farm and caused the demise of the farmer<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s land, making it impossible to plant anything but peanuts.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#x011a;</span>p<span class="small">&#224;</span></i> is a symbol of besiegement, as is the creeping plant known as <i>aagba</i> (<i>Stachytarpheta indica</i>), which wanted a quiet life in the forest. It made <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span></i>, and, like Peanut, took domain of everything in the forest. <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> represents the powers we find in any creeping weed that seeks to control a domain by subduing and <a id="page_266"></a>suppressing all others. It is a symbol of domination, but a weed is still a weed, and having the ability to extend yourself over a wide area is not synonymous with being wanted, useful or beneficial for anyone other than yourself. Similar symbolism applies to the aforementioned <i>aagba</i> (<i>Stachytarpheta indica</i>), which is a type of vervain that has proved efficient as a blood cleanser and in regulating high blood pressure, and <i><span class="small">&#237;</span>j<span class="small">&#242;</span>k<span class="small">&#249;</span>n</i> (<i>Mucuna poggei</i>), a type of climbing vine with oblong seed pods, a relative of peas and beans. Both of these have a tremendous capacity for besieging the environment into which they are introduced.</p>
<p class="indent">So, if we examine the plants associated with <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>, we see the tendency of wickedness to spread across the land and strangle everything good and fragile, noble and worthy, in its self centred appetite for dominion. But because of this, the peanut has a quality that makes it a ward against evil plots. The peanut represents dominion and, conversely, resistance in its capacity of entering the earth as a flower that breeds underground. So naturally, <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> is, like any <i>m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i>, both medicine and poison, just as the peanut symbolises both the spread of wickedness and resistance to it. The capacity for endurance, however, is represented here by <i><span class="small">&#232;</span>r<span class="small">&#249;</span>w<span class="small">&#224;</span></i> (the fresh grass) and the <i><span class="small">&#x025A;</span>p<span class="small">&#x0276;</span><span class="small">&#x0275;</span>r<span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i> bird (the brown-eared bulbul, <i>Microscelis amaurotis</i>), both of which serve as symbols for surviving war, devastation and antagonism.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> is a vibration that signals the presence of detractors and enemies, and a power that uses these debilitating forces to our advantage. We take advantage of these forces when we are able to use opposition and hostility, criticism and negativity, as means to define our station in life. <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> speaks of a condition in which we are surrounded by enemies, but the work at hand is to see oneself as <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>k<span class="small">&#232;</span></i>, the mountain. It is about forces that demand that we make informed and considered choices, to possess a clear consciousness and act in conformity with who we are, no matter what. We must stand strong in the midst of enemies <span class="small">&#8211;</span> and we can only stand strong when we are true to ourselves <span class="small">&#8211;</span> and the truth of self is always a good truth.</p>
<p class="indent">By extension, we can allow wickedness to enter, or shut it out. This idea is represented by the door, also born in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. But the door was weak, it needed three nails and a frame to become truly solid. The power of <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n is needed in the form of the nails that attach the door to a frame. The house the door is attached to is a reference to <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i>, which raises the question of what the door affixed to the house of your consciousness is hiding and protecting.</p>

<p class="indent">Just as Door made sacrifice to become strong, so did the cat. Cat was bullied by everyone and was pushed around all the time, especially by the rats who never gave her a minute of peace, trying to eat her and disturb her. One day when she was particularly tired, and so upset that she was contemplating suicide, she went to her <i>awo</i> for divination. She told her <i>awo</i> that she was miserable, fortune was always slipping away between her paws and she had no means to defend herself. The <i>awo</i> told her to make a sacrifice of razor blades and knives to <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> to enable her to stand her ground. She did as instructed, and was given claws; in this way she was able to get back at the rats that were terrorizing her.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> is about gaining tools for defence, but when defence turns to vengeance we need to question if we are applying the right tools to the situation at hand. The story of Cat is associated with In<span class="small">&#225;</span> (fire). Fire was the child of <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n, but he <a id="page_270"></a>was not appreciated. He was always feared for what he was. Over time, people started to use him for their own ends and it is actually in the story of the sacrifice Fire made that we find the kernel of <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>, because this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> is fiery and nocturnal. It speaks of fire given form through words and action. It is a force of denigration and protection, an energy so complex that humankind finds it difficult to use constructively.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> speaks of the challenges which confront each human being on their journey on earth. It speaks of the wish for recognition, the search for self and identity, bound to the gathering of personal power. It emphasises how misdirected this energy can be if we don<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t ensure that our character and consciousness are good, in the sense of attracting good, because <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> is also concerned with increase. <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> is the energy that reveals itself in wickedness, procrastination and misanthropy as much as it is the force that generates endurance and determination.</p>
<p class="indent">Another story from <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> illustrates these matters well. It is the story of T<span class="small">&#233;</span>nl<span class="small">&#233;</span> Ol<span class="small">&#250;</span>, who was so plagued by misfortune that he considered going into the woods to hang himself. This man had nothing but a simple shelter and two sets of clothing. He had no money, no wife and not even friends. He went to his <i>awo</i> and asked when his misfortunes would end. He was told that luck would come his way, but that he needed to sacrifice two pigeons. He had no money and so he decided to sell one of his garments and purchase the pigeons. His <i>awo</i> made the <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span></i> for him, and told him that good fortune was surely coming his way. T<span class="small">&#233;</span>nl<span class="small">&#233;</span> Ol<span class="small">&#250;</span> waited one month, two months, three months, but when nothing occurred in the fourth month, he decided that his <i>awo</i> was a liar and went into the woods to commit suicide. He went into the forest with a rope in search of a suitable tree to hang himself from. As he entered the forest he met <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>, who asked him what he was about to do. T<span class="small">&#233;</span>nl<span class="small">&#233;</span> Ol<span class="small">&#250;</span> said he was going to hang himself, and <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> responded that he thought it was an excellent idea and that he knew a perfect tree for this purpose. T<span class="small">&#233;</span>nl<span class="small">&#233;</span> Ol<span class="small">&#250;</span> accepted the guidance of <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> and together they went deeper into the forest. The further they ventured, the stronger a rotten odour of decay became, and T<span class="small">&#233;</span>nl<span class="small">&#233;</span> Ol<span class="small">&#250;</span> wanted to stop and find a tree close by to kill himself, but <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> urged him to walk on just a bit more. T<span class="small">&#233;</span>nl<span class="small">&#233;</span> Ol<span class="small">&#250;</span> accepted the advice of <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>, and went deeper into the forest, and the stench became more and more intolerable until they came to the source of the rotten odour. Two elephants had died there after fighting one another. Seeing this <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> said, <span class="small">&#8216;</span>Perhaps it is time to reconsider your suicide and instead take all this ivory and build your <a id="page_271"></a>fortune?<span class="small">&#8217;</span> T<span class="small">&#233;</span>nl<span class="small">&#233;</span> Ol<span class="small">&#250;</span> wasted no time and took all the ivory with him to sell at the market, and this was the turning point for him, where misfortune turned into good fortune.</p>
<p class="indent">In this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> the elephant is important, as it is a symbol of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span>. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> is in turn a symbol of the power that brought consciousness to the world. The importance of consciousness, and particularly the type of consciousness ascribed to the elephant/<span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> is important in <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>.</p>
<p class="indent">Another story relates how a city in chaos needed to sacrifice an elephant to get out of its misery. It seemed an impossible task, but the tortoise came up with a plan that was actually based upon deceiving the elephant to come to the city to meet its death. The elephant was naturally reluctant to go to a city of wickedness, but after being seduced by the talk of the tortoise, he went along and found his death. As a result of this, the city prospered and wickedness evaporated.</p>
<p class="indent">The story tells how Tortoise managed to bring the needed sacrifice to a city in violent trouble. The tortoise was not accorded much value, being slow, old and awkward, but it was nevertheless this creature protected by a hard shell (representing wisdom and cunning) which enabled the capture of a <span class="small">&#8216;</span>good consciousness<span class="small">&#8217;</span> for the city. The lengthy narrative tells of how the city managed to mobilize itself in a positive way around the tortoise to help him in his plan. It is a tale that speaks of cooperation and respect, especially for the elderly and weak, as the tenets for gaining a good <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i>. It is only when we work together that we can bring goodness in abundance, symbolized by the elephant. When we work together, we can make the impossible possible and reap its benefits.</p>
<p class="indent">Community is about recognizing individual talents and refraining from judging anyone as useless, as everything has its place, if we have a wide enough perspective to see how everything fits together. <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> teaches that positive reinforcement is a far better incentive than punitive action. And yet, the verse speaks of the mystery of control, direction and what we should do in order to reach our goals. It is only proper that it was in <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> that the <i><span class="small">&#232;</span>n<span class="small">&#236;</span>y<span class="small">&#224;</span>n</i>, the first humans, made sacrifice in order to gain control of their environment. So we find that the same energy that brings the fire of the individual, the fire of ambition and finding position, is the same energy that motivates us to take dominion and control, whether of self or others. Fire is the son of <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n, it is a child of strength with an elemental nature and it is our constitution and character that directs this force, whether in useful or destructive ways. One verse expresses this dilemma:</p>

<p class="indent">Choice can invite procrastination, selfishness, stubbornness and wickedness. These are born from hopelessness and self hatred. <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> is an <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> that speaks of this feeling of being lost, and warns against self sabotage, which takes shape in negative behaviour or indulging in useless pursuits. One verse is of interest in this regard. It tells of the king of <span class="small">&#204;</span>w<span class="small">&#233;</span>r<span class="small">&#233;</span>, who was encouraged to make <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span></i> because death was after him. The king however had other things to do, and always put it off, finding excuses for not doing it. One day when he was walking towards his palace, he suffered a heart attack on the road. He was found in time, and taken to the house of his If<span class="small">&#225;</span> priest who immediately produced the necessary material for <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span></i>, ensuring the survival of the king.

<p class="indent"><a id="page_273"></a>This verse hinges on a play between what is popular in the market, the locust bean and what is far less popular (and actually an If<span class="small">&#225;</span> taboo) palm kernel oil, suggesting that the king was not taking anything seriously, but rather indulged as much as he could in whatever pleased him, not caring whether it was good or bad for him. In a way, the king displayed an attitude of someone who had given up on life, someone who concluded that life was just a game of chance. But luck is something we prepare ourselves to receive by forging our fate. The verse speaks about taking responsibility for our life and choices, and of community. While the king neglected to do what was necessary, his diviner intervened and saved his life.</p>
<p class="indent">This verse is sometimes applied to <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span>ny<span class="small">&#236;</span>n, the spirit of herbs, who comes to fruition in the next <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. Nevertheless, the fire embedded in this sorcerous spirit originated in <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>. Being born in <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> reveals that he too came to earth with the need to learn his place in the world and to learn humility so that he could pursue his destiny with fervent ardour and concentration. The need to find one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s place is prominent in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. Here we find the <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>d<span class="small">&#225;</span>n</i> (bat) making <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span></i> in order to be fertile and find a place where she could be free from harassment. She made the <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span></i> and became fertile. She became a symbol of the good mother, and the love of children and the protective power which a mother holds. Fire here is conceived of as protective.</p>

<p class="indent">From the stories of the ant larva and the bat, we see that <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> speaks of finding your place in an environment that does not necessarily appreciate you. In both cases it speaks of endurance as much as it speaks of battle, fear and revolt, as when ants invade a garden, or a bat confusedly enters the house. It is about finding your place, and the turmoil that occurs when we are dislocated, such as when a warlord invades a neighbouring land, or simply being somewhere detrimental to one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s good fortune. <span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span> is commenting on social positions, as much as of individual destiny. These elements are encoded in the spirit of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#x025A;</span> and the concept of taboo.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#x025A;</span> came to earth in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. His parents were told beforehand that a great spirit would be born, that he would be renowned for good and for ill, and that upon his birth they had to give the child a hand of If<span class="small">&#225;</span> to ensure that his travels in the world would be for the sake of good. The cult of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#x025A;</span> is the nightside of that of Eg<span class="small">&#250;</span>ng<span class="small">&#250;</span>n, the ancestors. By nightside, I mean that it is related to the communication with ancestors as it takes place in the enigmatic environment of night, which symbolises what is hidden. His name, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#x025A;</span>, means <span class="small">&#8216;</span>word<span class="small">&#8217;</span> and is hence a reference to the power composed of breath, intent and direction. This <span class="small">&#8216;</span>word<span class="small">&#8217;</span> is also related to <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#x025A;</span>, which holds the power of sorcery, by using the word in secret <a id="page_275"></a>ways. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#x025A;</span> is a secret cult of sorcery, as is that of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#x025A;</span>. The former uses the power of the word found in <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i>, but this power is exercised in another <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#7865;</span>t<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i>, which will be detailed two chapters hence.</p>
<p class="indent">The stories of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#x025A;</span> reveal a clear and directed force, loyal and somewhat rigid in his insistence on law and character. One tale imparts how he was betrayed by his wife, and his rage was so great that she had no choice but to run away with her lover, never to be seen again. This exemplifies one of many incidents that identify <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#x025A;</span> as the embodiment of justice, law, ethics and morals. These are quite simple in a traditional Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span> society: develop good character, adhere to taboo, and be a person of your word.</p>
<p class="indent">We can understand <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#x025A;</span> to be the force that executes the content of our words in relation to our ancestry, because his cult is deeply tied to that of Eg<span class="small">&#250;</span>ng<span class="small">&#250;</span>n and funerary rites. His function is to purify society and to re-establish the straight way of If<span class="small">&#225;</span> when crooked ways have proliferated. The masked processions of <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#x025A;</span> use the bullroarer to announce their nocturnal and purifying dance through the village, calling upon snakes and <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>j<span class="small">&#x0276;</span></i> (in this context related to <span class="small">&#7884;</span>ya, or rather her mother, the tornado) to reinstate order and oath. Hence, taboo is a mediating force that establishes a code or law. So, in <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span></i> the concept of taboo and law is established, while in the following <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>t<span class="small">&#250;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>p<span class="small">&#x025A;</span>n</i>, the reason for it, and its remedy is divulged and explained.</p>
<p class="indent">Chief Fama (1993: 10<span class="small">&#8211;</span>13) has given an excellent presentation of these matters. I will therefore resort largely to her work in presenting laws and taboos. A taboo is largely a negative law that aims to compel good fortune to manifest. If what is taboo is avoided it encourages one to be open to good fortune, as what brings misfortune is not a part of one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s actions and thoughts. A taboo is something that we deny in favour of something else; it is the rejection of what impairs good fortune. The principle of taboo presented in the form of laws is from <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#225;</span>f<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i>, and the verse reads as follows:</p>

<p class="indent1">The verse gives advice on how to succeed in our human journey. If we summarize it, we end up with some simple guidelines, which will attract good fortune when they are followed:</p>
<p class="list1"><span class="list_num"><span class="small">&#183;</span></span> Don<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t claim to possess knowledge you don<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t have</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list_num"><span class="small">&#183;</span></span> Don<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t give your opinion unless asked</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list_num"><span class="small">&#183;</span></span> Don<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t make what is common appear special for the sake of advantage</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list_num"><span class="small">&#183;</span></span> Don<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t allow your personal and limited truth to contaminate others</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list_num"><span class="small">&#183;</span></span> Don<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t pretend to be someone or something you are not</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list_num"><span class="small">&#183;</span></span> Be honest with yourself and with the world</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list_num"><span class="small">&#183;</span></span> Don<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t pretend to be a friend when deceit lives in your heart</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list_num"><span class="small">&#183;</span></span> Don<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t make what is sacred profane and filthy</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list_num"><span class="small">&#183;</span></span> Don<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t be a menace to the weak and old</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list_num"><span class="small">&#183;</span></span> Don<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t take what is not yours</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list_num"><span class="small">&#183;</span></span> Don<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t indulge in gossip</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list_num"><span class="small">&#183;</span></span> Don<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t betray your word and oath</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list_num"><span class="small">&#183;</span></span> But do recognize your enemies</p>
<p class="indent1"><a id="page_278"></a>If you do break these laws and find misfortune hunting you down, don<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t accuse God, don<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t accuse your friends or your enemies, but rather accuse the enemy within, the wickedness in your soul. In confronting the challenge, rise above all this and attract what is good for you, which is done by paying attention to two rules of life: don<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t entertain slander and insult; and be conscious that you are here on earth because you desire a long, happy life, and so make choices that affirm this choice and desire.</p>
