<p class="noindent"><a id="page_155"></a><i> <span class="small">&#210;</span>d<span class="small">&#237;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> is symbolized by the buttocks, representing the meeting of equals. It is an <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> focussing on what is hidden within you, deep down at the centre of your essence. The <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> affirms the importance of the society in heaven, our divine reflection, and how our actions and attitudes on earth can obstruct this connection. <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>d<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> counsels us to be solidly planted in truth in order to erect the axis or pillar that generates a connection between earth and heaven. Truth in this context means knowing where you come from. It speaks of firmness of character and identity. We see this in the various spellings of <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>d<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> where the accent shifts, giving ideas of enmity, malice, abnormal or errant behavior and muteness as the negative vibrations found where the two halves of the buttocks do not meet in agreement. The buttocks, the two halves that join into a comfortable whole, are a symbol of peaceful union, a place of rest and comfort, for the meeting of soul-mates and the frustration that causes enmity. Yet, it also announces discomfort, as this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> is also concerned with giving birth.</p>
<p class="indent">The child of the first four <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span>s</i> is called M<span class="small">&#225;</span>y<span class="small">&#225;</span>m<span class="small">&#237;</span>, meaning <span class="small">&#8216;</span>Do not abandon me,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> and represents the condition of receiving good fortune in its totality:</p>

<p class="indent">This verse speaks of the great ease with which good fortune comes through this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. It highlights the importance of being grounded and steady. <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>d<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> also tells us of the challenges that come from having too easy a life and stresses the importance of practicing sacrifice in a spirit of gratitude and humility. In this story M<span class="small">&#225;</span>y<span class="small">&#225;</span>m<span class="small">&#237;</span> practiced sacrifice, and blessings continued to come to her. She was never abandoned by the spirits who brought good fortune.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_156"></a>Another story tells of On<span class="small">&#237;</span>k<span class="small">&#236;</span> <span class="small">&#7884;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>, who was profoundly blessed. She was repeatedly told to make sacrifice to keep her good fortune, but considering herself so amazingly blessed, saw no reason to do so. She travelled from city to city and made her fortune, but her good fortune caused envy, and in each city was driven away by accusations of witchcraft. Yet in each city she found good men, and she became the mother of four children by four different men. But each time the pattern repeated itself: at some point she was forced to leave the city, under the accusation of witchcraft. Finally she returned to her city of birth, Il<span class="small">&#233;</span> If<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>. Here she sought out an If<span class="small">&#225;</span> priest to make the sacrifice she had been told for many years she should perform. She was now very wealthy and her children were young men and had moved away. She didn<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t know her children anymore, or their fathers, nor did her children know one another. She wanted to mend this situation, but the If<span class="small">&#225;</span> priest said it was too late: the dispersion was too far gone.</p>
<p class="indent">This story serves as a warning that wealth is just one of several blessings and that we should not let it overshadow the others. It also serves as a reminder of the importance of building healthy community and relationships in conformity with the sign of this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, the buttocks. The importance of love, generosity and friendship are implied here as powers that counteract the development of pride and selfishness that are present as a negative vibration in <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>d<span class="small">&#237;</span></i>.</p>
<p class="indent">In the example of Y<span class="small">&#249;</span>ngb<span class="small">&#225;</span>, who like On<span class="small">&#237;</span>k<span class="small">&#236;</span> <span class="small">&#7884;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> was surrounded by wealth and good fortune, pride and self centeredness caused her to ignore advice and close relationships. She ended up very lonely and sad in her wealth. The positive reflex of Y<span class="small">&#249;</span>ngb<span class="small">&#225;</span> is associated with the rat. <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>d<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> tells that Rat was of royal descent, handsome and not afraid to work hard to achieve his goals. His underground home was a magnificent and cunning structure. Rat was very friendly and liked to show off his accomplishments and victories to his relatives <span class="small">&#8211;</span> after all, he worked hard for everything he had, and he thought his efforts would inspire his relatives to build their own good fortunes. But his relatives did not become inspired to work on their good fortune, instead their envy and resentment grew daily. One day his relatives, consumed by envy, decided to report him to their king, Leopard. They went to the king and told stories coloured by their envy, stating that Rat should be expelled from the kingdom. Leopard considered the allegations serious and summoned Rat to defend his case. Upon receiving the summons, Rat went to an If<span class="small">&#225;</span> priest who told him that there was a plot amongst his relatives to cast him out of the forest, and he advised him to make sacrifice so <a id="page_157"></a>that the matter would end in his favour. Rat made sacrifice and embarked on the journey to Leopard<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s palace. The allegations were about the habits of Rat, that since he looked like a squirrel, he should dwell in a nest, and that living in a hole was not appropriate for him. Rat defended himself cleverly against these absurd allegations. He pleaded his case well and it was found in his favour, he was free to live where he wanted and in whatever way he found pleasing.</p>
<p class="indent">The story tells us about the condition of the world, how good fortune does not necessarily inspire kindness and benevolence in people, but quite the opposite. Envy is a complex energy in itself. We tend to see envy as the desire to possess what someone else has, and this is correct enough, but it is also followed by the feeling that people blessed with good fortune do not deserve it. One verse says the following about this:</p>

<p class="indent">First and foremost, this verse teaches the importance of always thinking and speaking with benevolence if we wish to attract good fortune. On a deeper level, it speaks of the nature of attraction <span class="small">&#8211;</span> that good thoughts and words will attract goodness, while negative ones will affect our soul, and malice will take shape within us. The presence of malice shows itself in the desire to be hurtful towards other people.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_158"></a>If<span class="small">&#225;</span> tells of three spiritual powers in particular: the spirit of wisdom, the spirit of medicine and herbs, and witches. These three are the usual scapegoats when people experience misfortune and seek to blame someone else instead of understanding a given situation. Going deeper, we realize that whatever is hurtful for someone will also be hurtful for that person<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s spiritual double, the society of heaven. Malice breeds more malice.</p>
<p class="indent">If<span class="small">&#225;</span> considers words as statements and statements are declarations of desire and wishes; a form of prayer. Words reveal who we are, and have the power to generate both good and evil, hence we find the taboo against gossip. Idle talk about people not present in a conversation is considered to be malicious. Gossip reveals malice, a desire to hurt someone, and is often motivated by envy.</p>
<p class="indent">Or<span class="small">&#237;</span> made sacrifice in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> because it felt lonely, and so was given mouth, tongue, ears, eyes and a nose to bring about a harmonious gathering of the faculties. But as we all know, these can also lead to dispersion; for example, misunderstandings through hearing and hurtful words uttered as a result of errors of perception can occur. It is of paramount importance that we allow wisdom to be the guide of consciousness. Words can bless and they can curse, but intelligence, which was born here, can make the difference.</p>
<p class="indent">All aspects of <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>d<span class="small">&#237;</span></i>, both good and bad, riches and selfishness, generosity and envy, wit and seclusion, can be found in the many narratives that speak of Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>kun, the owner of the marine waters. This spirit represents mystery and intelligence and is said to live at the bottom of the ocean. The bottom of the ocean is considered the buttocks of creation. Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>kun is considered male in some traditions and female in others, and is said to manifest as dragons and snakes of the ocean, and as mermaids and mermen.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the stories of Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>kun tells that she was the source of amphibian creatures, and was unhappy with her condition, being neither earth nor water, but a bit of both. The story recounts how she fell in love with <span class="small">&#210;</span><span class="small">&#242;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>oko, the spirit of the farm, a quiet, wise and reserved spirit. Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>kun went to an If<span class="small">&#225;</span> priest to see what her options were. She wanted to marry <span class="small">&#210;</span><span class="small">&#242;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>oko but was ashamed of her appearance. The If<span class="small">&#225;</span> priest told her not to worry and that she should make sacrifice, but she chose not to. Instead she assumed an earthly form and went to work for <span class="small">&#210;</span><span class="small">&#242;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>oko. In a matter of days <span class="small">&#210;</span><span class="small">&#242;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>oko and Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>kun developed a friendship and she told him about her dual nature. Fascinated by this, <span class="small">&#210;</span><span class="small">&#242;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>oko told her secret to his friends and soon everybody knew about her strange condition. She became <a id="page_159"></a>very upset and left the farm and decided to make the ocean her permanent home. However, at times she showed herself as a mermaid, a dragon, snake or other marine creature. She swore no one would know her true nature and in this declaration we find a vital theme of this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>; the balance between making yourself known, and how the world tempers this wish, leading to concealment or revelation and the act of demonstrating strength and prominence in the world.</p>
<p class="indent">In relation to this theme we find the story that tells of how Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>kun challenged <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> to a battle of wits and strength for complete rulership of the world, the waters and dry land. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> sent his messenger, Chameleon, to speak on his behalf. When Chameleon entered the palace of Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>kun he saw that he was dressed in rich and costly garments and jewels. In keeping with the nature of Chameleon, he dressed in the same fine clothing as Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>kun. When Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>kun saw this, he became upset and went to change into even more beautiful clothes; and so did Chameleon. This happened several times, and on the seventh time, Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>kun gave up and told the chameleon that the challenge was over: he was not interested in fighting someone whose messenger was dressed as beautifully as himself, and accepted the dominion of the ocean as being a kingdom sufficient for him.</p>
<p class="indent">These two stories tell us about the presence of mystery in the world as much as they tell us about the dangers of pride and the nature of fame. Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>kun represents the power of wealth and mystery, but it is also the spirit that brought intelligence to <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i>. Intelligence is represented by the crab because of its hard shell and claws that protect its mystery. Also in these two stories Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>kun was advised to practice sacrifice, but he ended up not doing so because he saw himself as being so powerful and rich that it was not necessary. Here is an admonition to protect good fortune by practicing sacrifice and a reminder to avoid gossip.</p>
<p class="indent">As we see in the narratives of Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>kun, deception and plotting came into the world through the possession of riches and fame. This is the negative reflex to forming healthy partnerships and honourable concords. As we saw in the story of Rat, envy is the author of much of the plotting and deception in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="small">&#210;</span>d<span class="small">&#237;</span>, who was a great warrior in heaven, brought the thunderstone (<span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span>) and the furnace (<span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n) to earth, and thunder became <span class="small">&#210;</span>d<span class="small">&#237;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s loyal protector. <span class="small">&#210;</span>d<span class="small">&#237;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s helpers in heaven were playfulness, pleasure and dance. When they came to earth, they constantly gravitated to the outside; they wanted to disperse themselves everywhere. Hence we see how division and scheming are born, but also the ability to spread out, to generate increase and growth. Before <span class="small">&#210;</span>d<span class="small">&#237;</span> came to <a id="page_160"></a>earth, he accomplished astonishing deeds in heaven and we find him victorious in all his works. One story speaks of him challenging death, who was a many headed beast, a dragon. Here the story reads like a version of St George<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s battle with the dragon, but the battle does not end with <span class="small">&#210;</span>d<span class="small">&#237;</span> slaying the dragon, rather he discovers that communion, generosity, and understanding is the key to making benevolent alliances. In an extension of the motif of St George and his pilgrimage through the Campo Stellare, it is interesting to see that it was in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> that the sun (<i>aj<span class="small">&#237;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>nw<span class="small">&#224;</span></i>) was born. <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>d<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> tells us that the sun and its 200 needles were spread across a white cloth and turned into the starry heavens.</p>
<p class="indent">Stories of On<span class="small">&#237;</span>k<span class="small">&#236;</span> <span class="small">&#7884;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> (who we met earlier in this chapter) appear in verses warning against setting one child against another. Brothers who don<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t know each other end up fighting, a motif similar to the biblical story of Cain and Abel. These stories are concerned with how a solid foundation is generated by the harmonious gathering of two halves, and how dispersion, envy, wrath and egotism are born by refusing to allow this gathering to take place. This concept is similar to the <i>symbolon</i> we find in Plato<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s <i>Symposium</i>. In the <i>Symposium</i> we learn that the world is broken, that we are parts gravitating towards one another to a primordial union, joining what was sundered in order to generate completeness. In <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>d<span class="small">&#237;</span></i>, we see the consequence of the broken calabash as told of in <i><span class="small">&#200;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span> Ogb<span class="small">&#232;</span></i> where consciousnesses were spread all over the world. <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>d<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> emphasizes the challenge in bringing this primordial dispersion into a harmonious whole and as such, <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>d<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> is the pulse of the populated world with all its challenges and blessings.</p>
<p class="indent">The gun was born here. Gun was a son of <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n. A story tells how Gun was consumed by feelings of dread and threat, of being surrounded by enemies. He was unaware of his powers and his father told him to speak if he wanted to avoid death. He spoke and a gunshot sounded and then many more, enemies died and the threat was dispersed. The manifestation of the gun in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> speaks of a crisis in human society where dispersion has become antagonism and enmity.</p>
<p class="indent">Salt comes to the world as a reminder of sweetness. But the neglect of sweetness and the adoration of salt brings about more bitterness, feuds and dispersion. As a consequence of this, we find epidemics coming into being, especially diseases that travel through the air and water. This world, the marketplace, is a place in flux where honey and salt provide the contrast that enables us to manoeuvre between these poles through the use of our senses and intelligence. The idea of human life as a journey of contrasts comes into manifestation here.</p>

She is a popular <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i> in the Diaspora and is found as patron in both Cuba and Brazil. Mother of the ocean and the lunar nights, the <i>stella matutina</i>, she is found as a protector of motherhood and as a solution for barrenness. She is the spirit of wealth; the author of the energy from which money was made, as well as a warrior and a sorceress. We can see in Y<span class="small">&#x00eb;</span>m<span class="small">&#7885;</span>ja the archetype of the independent woman. We find her as a co-creator of the world, as mother of the <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>s</i> and as the author of the deluge that wiped out the first humans. She is portrayed as a witch, a diviner and mother of the stars. She is connected with children and family. She exemplifies the human condition, and the essence of this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. When she decides to go and live with Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>kun, the spirit of the ocean, she exemplifies the fluid, emotional temperament that moves humanity: inconsistent, peaceful, wrathful, hungry and full of all forms of abundance.</p>
<p class="indent">Y<span class="small">&#x00eb;</span>m<span class="small">&#7885;</span>ja is a free spirit, a symbol of the one who travels and finds good fortune, as in the following story which addresses the human journey and such phenomena as jealousy and freedom. Y<span class="small">&#x00eb;</span>m<span class="small">&#7885;</span>ja was going to visit her fianc<span class="small">&#233;</span> <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n. She left her village and went through the forest where she accidentally fell into a trap designed for catching antelope. <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> rescued her from the trap and helped her gather together the gifts that had got broken when she fell, and mended them for her. A sweet atmosphere arose between them there in the woods, and they made love. In the morning she headed off towards her meeting with <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n and paused in a village to eat and refresh herself, but a thief stole all her gifts. When she broke out in tears over their loss. <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> showed up, and asked her what the matter was. She told him that all her presents had been stolen, but <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> told her not to worry, and they went to the market together where he bought her more items than had been stolen from her. Once again a sweet atmosphere arose, and they went to his house to make love. The following morning, she was given a horse to carry all the gifts, and went on to meet with <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n, her fianc<span class="small">&#233;</span>. She was very happy; she had many fine gifts and even a horse to give to her beloved. She arrived at the city of <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n and walked proudly and happily to the market in search of her fianc<span class="small">&#233;</span>. She did not notice that <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n was sitting in a tavern with his friends <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> and <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>. When she appeared in the market, <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#236;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span> exclaimed to his friends that he had a night of love together with this woman that had just entered. <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> said that he had as well, and, on <a id="page_164"></a>hearing this, <span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>n rose to his feet, red with rage, and declared with thunderous determination that his friends had been making love to his fianc<span class="small">&#233;</span>. He went over to Y<span class="small">&#x00eb;</span>m<span class="small">&#7885;</span>ja and confronted her aggressively over the matter. She dropped everything, and told him that she was not interested in this abuse and would rather go to live with Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>kun, the spirit of wealth who dwells at the bottom of the ocean. And so she did.</p>
<p class="indent">There are several variations of this story and the themes are always the same. Y<span class="small">&#x00eb;</span>m<span class="small">&#7885;</span>ja is a spirit who attracts wealth and riches, and wants to share herself. The story speaks of judgment and the freedom of the individual, of how <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>d<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> created individual differences, and of how what might be good for one person could prove bad for another. It is a call to harmony through observing the beautiful diversity we find in the world. Not only this, but <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>d<span class="small">&#237;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> as manifested in the form of Y<span class="small">&#x00eb;</span>m<span class="small">&#7885;</span>ja is the very power that brings the penis and vagina together. She is the power of passion and sexual attraction, which is the harmonious gathering that does not only bring forth offspring, but also erotic pleasure. In this we find the root of dispersion and union. The erotic imagery typical of this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> is even stronger in the following verse:</p>

</div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_166"></a>This market chief, <span class="small">&#7884;</span><span class="small">&#242;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span> <span class="small">&#x00d5;</span>ja, is the same spirit as Aj<span class="small">&#233;</span> <span class="small">&#7778;</span>aluga, because dominion over the market is assigned to the spirit vested in either of these names. Like Y<span class="small">&#x00eb;</span>m<span class="small">&#7885;</span>ja they are <i>funfun</i>, meaning that they are connected to the world of dreams and the beginning of the world. In this story it is <span class="small">&#210;</span>d<span class="small">&#237;</span>, as the archetypical warrior knight of heaven, who enters the market and passionately makes love to <span class="small">&#7884;</span><span class="small">&#242;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span> <span class="small">&#x00d5;</span>ja. This causes a ripple of desire, in which everybody else wants to make love to <span class="small">&#7884;</span><span class="small">&#242;</span>s<span class="small">&#225;</span> <span class="small">&#x00d5;</span>ja, who appears to be dripping with honey and sweetness.</p>
<p class="indent">In a related verse, we learn that Aj<span class="small">&#233;</span> <span class="small">&#7778;</span>aluga defecates everywhere, but that her defecation is always money or a sign of coming wealth. One verse says that if you are touched by Aj<span class="small">&#233;</span> <span class="small">&#7778;</span>aluga, abundance and riches will shower on you like <span class="small">&#8216;</span>the droppings of pigeons.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> This signals that dreams of defecation are as much an omen of coming riches as a reminder not to embrace wealth too fondly. Aj<span class="small">&#233;</span> <span class="small">&#7778;</span>aluga is an important spiritual force. She is the sister of Eg<span class="small">&#250;</span>ng<span class="small">&#250;</span>n and the first wife of Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>kun, and is said to comprise part of the faculty of intelligence. In fact, another verse of <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>d<span class="small">&#237;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> erases the distinction between Aj<span class="small">&#233;</span> <span class="small">&#7778;</span>aluga and Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>kun and says they combine to form the <span class="small">&#8216;</span>most ancient crown.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> When Ol<span class="small">&#243;</span>kun, the mystery of the bottom of the ocean, wishes to be known, he is declared by the presence of Aj<span class="small">&#233;</span> <span class="small">&#7778;</span>aluga in the marketplace, as the mother of sweetness and wealth. This is a reminder about the importance of togetherness, that it is in togetherness that we make sweetness.</p>
<p class="indent">The greenwood is sacred in <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>d<span class="small">&#237;</span></i>. Naturally we find all water plants, like lotus and lily, here, but the sacred trees of this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> are the coconut palm (<i>cocos nucifera</i>) and mangrove. Mangroves are sacred because of their remarkable ability to isolate salt, and coconut fruit because of their inner sweetness and rich water beneath their dark and hard surface. The <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> also holds a particular affinity with <i>Psychotria viridis</i> and <i>Banisteriopsis caapi</i>, a shrub and a vine, that together generate yag<span class="small">&#233;</span> or ayahuasca. All these plants remind us that togetherness is what breeds beauty, health, long life and contact with one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s spirit double.</p>
<p class="indent">The importance of togetherness is also demonstrated by the spiritual force known as <span class="small">&#210;</span>ge, who is born in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. One story tells of how <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> was poisoned after preparing a meal of pigeons using a <span class="small">&#8216;</span>secret ingredient<span class="small">&#8217;</span> he was given by someone he met at the market. He didn<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t realize that it was a poison, and as it started to work through his system he curled up on the floor in pain, crying for help. <span class="small">&#210;</span>ge came to his aid with the antidote. She is represented by the two horns of the antelope, and is believed to be the force that influenced the formation <a id="page_167"></a>of the G<span class="small">&#x00eb;</span>l<span class="small">&#x00eb;</span>d<span class="small">&#x00eb;</span> society. Her horns are both a remedy against barrenness and an antidote to malefica. The horns of the antelope, which are considered the presence of <span class="small">&#210;</span>ge, are associated with the cornucopia, as nearly all songs and prayers in her praise mention her infallible ability to bestow blessings. They emphasise how she is a dynamic and upright force which tempers people<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s character. An If<span class="small">&#225;</span> proverb says: <span class="small">&#8216;</span>When things are going well for them, that is when they start to misbehave.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> It is in this context that <span class="small">&#210;</span>ge enters as a power of rectification.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#210;</span>d<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> reminds us that the human journey should be a good one: if it is not, the problem is in how we choose to walk in the world. We all want blessings and good fortune, riches and all good things. Blessings take shape as a result of togetherness, a kind disposition and through the cultivation, and finally possession, of good character.</p>

<p class="noindent"><i>I entered without hesitation, as if I was the child of the owner</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>But I am not the child of the owner</i></p>

<p class="indent">The sentence <i>Mo d<span class="small">&#233;</span> rere</i> at the beginning of this verse is tied in with <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>w<span class="small">&#224;</span> rere</i>, a good, calm and joyous consciousness, which is the spirit in which we should travel in order to arrive well. <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>d<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> speaks of the importance of making our human journey as heroes in our own lives, possessed with the intelligence and wisdom to distinguish between wormwood, salt and honey. We must appreciate <a id="page_168"></a>that gathering together in harmony is the basis from which abundance sprouts. When your life gets better, mine does too.</p>
<p class="indent">Quite simply, this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> says: do good and you will be recognized, not as a man or woman with a mission, but as someone with vision. In doing so, the judgment of others and the gossip born from envy should be forgotten, so that our thoughts and words will always be the thoughts and words of goodness. We can accept the mysterious journey we share with all our fellow voyagers, no matter the form within which their consciousness resides.</p>
