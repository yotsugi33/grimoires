These two <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span>s</i> have a strong symbiotic relationship, in which <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>k<span class="small">&#224;</span>nr<span class="small">&#224;</span>n</i> is both the explanation of <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span></i> and the sum of the wisdom which it brings us.</p>
<p class="indent">As we recall, <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span></i> is a very active energy, the force of the impaired head that invites confusion. This state is reflected in the proverb which says: <span class="small">&#8216;</span>We have consulted <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>k<span class="small">&#224;</span>nr<span class="small">&#224;</span>n m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i>, so I am getting up from where they are speaking badly about a friend and I am going to sit in a better place.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>k<span class="small">&#224;</span>nr<span class="small">&#224;</span>n</i> is concerned with how to avoid wickedness. This <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> teaches us how to avoid wickedness and how to reap the blessings of wealth and authority in <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span></i>.</p>
<p class="indent">We always exert attraction in relation to where we are on our path. Bad people will find bad people and good people will find good people, but sometimes it is not easy to distinguish a friend from a foe, and we might find ourselves entertaining friendships with the hyenas of the world. Even as we grow wise in knowledge we can make such errors, and sometimes we are loved because those who love us do so from selfish love. As we see gatherings of wicked people who seem to accumulate followers, we can grow frustrated in anticipation of the disaster and cruelty being prepared for us. But wickedness only sprouts wickedness and before too long it will collapse upon itself like a dead star.</p>
<p class="indent">The wicked tend to raise flags because, driven by the spirit of gluttony, they seek to dominate through associations, councils and various confederations. They come with pure faces, playing upon people<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s desire to make the world better, which is the bait they use to invite good people into their company. Goodness calls out as well, but rarely do we see it putting out flags. Goodness speaks softly. Goodness never insists upon changing the world before we have changed ourselves. Where the wicked seek to establish societies, they also seek to conceal their wickedness in the skin and lustre of what they are not. The sweet talk, the favours with a price, and the constant talk of needing to defend ourselves against evil, to become a closed group in order to guard our interests; these are steps on the road of intimacy that should be trod with care. Goodness does not need protection. No council is needed to ensure that goodness is done. It is like the sun, that sees no wickedness where it blazes and shines in its fiery purity.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_217"></a><i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>k<span class="small">&#224;</span>nr<span class="small">&#224;</span>n</i> is broadly about discernment, it is deeply related to the heart and emotions, but more than anything it explains the mysteries of any dyadic relationship or polarity. This is why a metaphor for <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>k<span class="small">&#224;</span>nr<span class="small">&#224;</span>n</i> is a pair of magnets, in opposition or conjoined, or two pieces of iron joined together, a token of a strong bond being the best defence against enemies and negative forces. This <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> tells us how sadness can help us master difficulties. It is here that remedies for a barren womb are sought.</p>
<p class="indent">The <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span></i> tree (<i>Ceiba penantra</i>) is an aphrodisiac having major associations with spiritual forces such as <i><span class="small">&#237;</span>w<span class="small">&#237;</span>n</i> and <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>gb<span class="small">&#7865;</span></i>; it signals the meeting point between two worlds or forces. <span class="small">&#192;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span> was subject to the envy of the other trees. He was a melancholy spirit who did not have belief in his own greatness. He came across as arrogant, and so the other trees wanted him eliminated. But <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> saved him and the conspirators against him were chopped down. Most trees arrived on earth in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. Many of them refused to make <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span></i>, but this was not the case with <span class="small">&#192;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>. He made <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span></i> before coming to earth, but his enemy <span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#243;</span>k<span class="small">&#242;</span> did not, because he felt omnipotent and strong, and was sure that his intimidating presence would protect him from any danger. When they arrived on earth, Ar<span class="small">&#224;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span> was rewarded with prestige, but <span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#243;</span>k<span class="small">&#242;</span> on the other hand was turned into timber. It so happened that <span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#243;</span>k<span class="small">&#242;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s hubris and refusal to make the necessary sacrifice caused <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> to decide to end his fierce reputation. He went to several cities close to where <span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#243;</span>k<span class="small">&#242;</span> was living and told people that this strong and beautiful tree was not dangerous, but that it was excellent material from which to make doors and woodwork. At first people were reluctant, but when <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> took up the axe and led them out to show them just how little they had to fear, they followed him to <span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#243;</span>k<span class="small">&#242;</span>. His majesty was truly intimidating, but as <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> struck <span class="small">&#204;</span>r<span class="small">&#243;</span>k<span class="small">&#242;</span> with the axe the people realized that he was only a tree after all, and they took up their axes and turned him into timber and artworks.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>k<span class="small">&#224;</span>nr<span class="small">&#224;</span>n</i> speaks of the presence of enemies and traitors, and warns us of the negative effects of taking punitive actions. One has more to gain in complicated situations by limiting oneself to threats and intimidation in order to mark boundaries. There are two stories of interest in this regard. One speaks of how <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> and <span class="small">&#192;</span>gb<span class="small">&#242;</span> (Ram) decided to take up farming together to make their fortune with yams, bananas and tubers. Ram was quite well off, but <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> was not in a good financial situation, so Ram decided to enter into this partnership more to help his friend than himself. When they found a promising spot, they went <a id="page_218"></a>to an <i>awo</i> to ask if the land was good for planting. The <i>awo</i> told them it was excellent, and so they embarked on their venture together. The land was bountiful and before long, large amounts of fruits and vegetables were ready to be harvested. They were both full of joy at these great results, but when they came to make the harvest, they found to their dismay that somebody had already been there in the night and stolen more than half of their crops. They went to the diviner to see if they could find out who the thief was, and the <i>awo</i> said that it was someone very close to them, and told them to make a sacrifice to <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span> at the farm. When they were about to leave, the <i>awo</i> took hold of Ram and instructed him to watch the <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span></i> throughout the night. They made the prescribed sacrifice to <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>, and stayed watching the crops as night fell, when both got hungry and decided to end the vigil and go home to eat. And so they parted in the night and agreed to meet the next morning. But once he had eaten, Ram decided to go back and complete the vigil. He returned to the farm and what he saw overcame him with a great sadness; for there he found <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> and a bunch of bandits taking away the entire plantation. Ram became infuriated, and ran screaming at <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> challenging him to fight. They fought until daybreak, when <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> decided to run away from this shameful situation. But the rumours of his disgraceful acts ran faster than his legs and from village to village he was confronted by people asking why he had treated his best friend in such a disgraceful way. The charges and gossip did not end until <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> decided to end his journey and return to <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run.</p>
<p class="indent">It is in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> that Ab<span class="small">&#237;</span>af<span class="small">&#236;</span>n descended into the world from <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run, and became known as <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span>. Ab<span class="small">&#237;</span>af<span class="small">&#236;</span>n was born into the royal family of <span class="small">&#7884;</span>y<span class="small">&#7885;</span>, and in his naming ceremony (<i><span class="small">&#236;</span>k<span class="small">&#7885;</span>s<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>d<span class="small">&#225;</span>y<span class="small">&#233;</span></i>) it became evident that he was very close to the <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span>, both in fate and personality. <i><span class="small">&#204;</span>k<span class="small">&#7885;</span>s<span class="small">&#x0275;</span>d<span class="small">&#225;</span>y<span class="small">&#233;</span></i> means to <span class="small">&#8216;</span>place one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s feet on the earth,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> and consists of a reading for a child<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s destiny in which its name is discovered. The name given reflects the fate and aspiration of the person.</p>
<p class="indent">As Ab<span class="small">&#237;</span>af<span class="small">&#236;</span>n grew up, he demonstrated such excellence in leadership, and so many similarities to the <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#7865;</span></i> after whom he had been named, that people ceased to be aware of any difference between the king who became <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i> and <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> himself. It should be mentioned that the success of Ab<span class="small">&#237;</span>af<span class="small">&#236;</span>n was due to his friendship with <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>t<span class="small">&#225;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> and the importance he gave to always keeping his <i>or<span class="small">&#237;</span></i> calm. But there are other spiritual forces that must be discussed in relation to S<span class="small">&#224;</span>ngo in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, as they will more clearly illustrate the dynamic between <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#7865;</span></i>, <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i>, <i><span class="small">&#232;</span>n<span class="small">&#236;</span>y<span class="small">&#224;</span>n</i>, and <i>eg<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i>.</p>
<p class="image"><a id="page_219"></a><img src="docimages/f0219-01.jpg" height="100%" alt="Image"/><a id="page_220"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_221"></a>J<span class="small">&#224;</span>k<span class="small">&#250;</span>ta (the stone thrower) and <span class="small">&#7884;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span>mf<span class="small">&#x0276;</span> (saviour of Ife) represent wrathful and protective aspects of <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> directed towards the annihilation of enemies. Although these powers are sometimes seen to be the same as <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span>, they are not. J<span class="small">&#224;</span>k<span class="small">&#250;</span>ta and <span class="small">&#7884;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span>mf<span class="small">&#x0276;</span> are <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>r<span class="small">&#250;</span>nm<span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#7865;</span></i>, and are the primordial powers that resonated with the spirit and vibration of <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> and caused him to become a divinity. As such <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span>, the fourth Al<span class="small">&#225;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>fin of <span class="small">&#7884;</span>y<span class="small">&#7885;</span>, was elevated as an <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i> in the likeness of the celestial power known as <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> upon his death.</p>
<p class="indent">In this we see the traditional Yor<span class="small">&#249;</span>b<span class="small">&#225;</span> idea of what an <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i> is. An <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i> can be a shard of a greater consciousness in itself, but <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i> is also a state reached by living a remarkable life in harmony with the celestial forces. It follows that in order for a spirit engaged in its human journey to become <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i>, he or she must live life in a conscious and active way, in harmony with celestial ideas and vibrations, so that death brings the moment of transfiguration. This means that <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i> is a spiritual force, established by death. It is from the bones (<i>eg<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i>) of one<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s experiences that one rises into recognition as <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i>. This is a metaphysical dynamic that involves a spiritual afflatus, the human condition, death and rebirth. Rebirth can involve a return to earth where the journey is taken yet again, or it can be a reincarnation in the form of <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i>. It is necessary to attain the condition of <i>eg<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i> in order to become <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i>, but not all <i>eg<span class="small">&#250;</span>ns</i> actually become <i><span class="small">&#242;</span>r<span class="small">&#236;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span></i>.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span>, Lord of the Crossroads, is active here as the divine linguist.

<p class="indent">This verse has an alternative rendering, found in a story about a struggling <i>awo</i> with a good heart. In the alternative we learn that <i>awo</i> <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>k<span class="small">&#224;</span>nr<span class="small">&#224;</span>n had divined for a person and prescribed the necessary sacrifice and set a time for him to come and make the <i><span class="small">&#7865;</span>b<span class="small">&#7885;</span></i>, but the client didn<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t show up. Instead of accepting the client<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s decision, he went to his house to confront him. It caused embarassment to the client, and damaged the <i>awo</i><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s reputation. Clearly this has an admonition not to charge people with their shortcomings. It also speaks of the finer nuances of personal interaction, both on a professional and social level. Not only this, but such behaviour also calls upon the attention of the Elders of the Night (the <span class="small">&#204;</span>y<span class="small">&#225;</span> Mis) and <span class="small">&#200;</span><span class="small">&#7779;</span><span class="small">&#249;</span><span class="small">&#8217;</span>s negative vibration in a way that can often block our good fortune.</p>
<p class="indent">This is illustrated by another story that speaks of <span class="small">&#192;</span>k<span class="small">&#249;</span>k<span class="small">&#7885;</span> d<span class="small">&#237;</span>e <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>t<span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#224;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>nj<span class="small">&#224;</span>, which means <span class="small">&#8216;</span>The big and solid rooster.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> He was a very talented <i>awo</i>, but he was also very young, in his early 20s. In spite of his youth, his reputation was already quite legendary, and he always experienced success, which brought him even greater popularity. He grew so confident about his great talent that he decided to challenge the diviners of the king to a competition of knowledge and skill. His main objective was to force the elder <i>babal<span class="small">&#225;</span>wos</i> to let the younger ones take on prominent positions amongst the royal diviners, because some of them, like himself, were clearly more skilled and talented than many of those holding important positions at court.</p>
<p class="indent">Before he set out on his mission, he went to his <i>awo</i> and asked for advice. His <i>awo</i> told him that he should approach this mission with humility and respect lest he would be disgraced. He was asked to make a sacrifice, not that he needed to humble himself for anyone when he knew better and was more skilled. His <i>awo</i> told him to think better on this and blessed him. <span class="small">&#192;</span>k<span class="small">&#249;</span>k<span class="small">&#7885;</span> d<span class="small">&#237;</span>e <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>t<span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#224;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>nj<span class="small">&#224;</span> grew offended with the elderly <i>babal<span class="small">&#225;</span>wo</i>, and swore never to set foot in his house again. Nevertheless, he had someone deliver the materials for sacrifice along with some money for him on the following day. A few days later he went to the king<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s court, convinced that his greatness would be recognized. Once there, he lost no time in showing off his great skills, and he took control of every aspect of the diviners<span class="small">&#8217;</span> work, in a patronizing way, to call attention to his own excellence. The diviners at the king<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s court let him act out his great hubris until he <a id="page_224"></a>was satisfied with his display of knowledge and skill. As he was about to take his leave, confident that he would soon be called to be the chief diviner, some of the awos at the court gathered together and cursed him (though some accounts tell that they blessed him). <span class="small">&#192;</span>k<span class="small">&#249;</span>k<span class="small">&#7885;</span> d<span class="small">&#237;</span>e <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>t<span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#224;</span>l<span class="small">&#224;</span>nj<span class="small">&#224;</span> went home, but already on the road things started to go badly for him. Rain damaged most of the goods he had been given by the king, and at home his work as a diviner started to fall apart. Nothing he did led to the desired results and clients were leaving him, along with his good reputation. Seeing the negative turn his life had taken, he went back to his <i>awo</i>, whom he had sworn never to return to, and asked in a spirit of humility how his situation could be rectified. His <i>awo</i> told him that he should change his attitude and demanded that he give up his beautiful tail feathers to be used as a part of the sacrifice. He did so. His <i>awo</i> called upon <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> M<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i>, and from that moment on, his disgrace was turned to recognition and he regained his reputation.</p>
<p class="indent">This story demonstrates the theme of not going where you are not invited, as well as the deep relationship that exists between this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> and <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span></i>. In this case <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span></i> is the lucky charm of <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>k<span class="small">&#224;</span>nr<span class="small">&#224;</span>n</i>. We can understand this relationship as being represented by the left and right eye, and the manner in which these are connected to second sight. The right eye sees only wealth and possibility, while the left sees only gloom and negativity. Second sight is the power of discernment, which arises from intuition that pulsates through the heart. It is only with the eye of the heart that we truly <span class="small">&#8216;</span>see<span class="small">&#8217;</span> the world. When a human being does not have this capacity, the world is perceived in terms of black and white, good or evil. Second sight and intuition invite the shades and nuances necessary for understanding that everything is as it is supposed to be, because we are, after all, the authors of our own fortune and misfortune. The concept of the dyad and of polarity is further explored in the relationship between <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> and <span class="small">&#7884;</span>ya, as exemplified in the following verse:</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_227"></a>It is important to observe the balance between partners in a relationship. The reason why <span class="small">&#7884;</span>ya is hailed as stronger than <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> is not only because of her more subtle methods, but because she is related to the <i><span class="small">&#236;</span>m<span class="small">&#x0273;</span>l<span class="small">&#x0275;</span></i> known as Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span>lal<span class="small">&#224;</span>, the sum of the ancestral mothers who manifested the tornado. Because of this, <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>k<span class="small">&#224;</span>nr<span class="small">&#224;</span>n</i> is particularly concerned with respect for woman and insists upon her importance in a healthy marriage or partnership. This includes the need to be careful and selective over who one chooses as a companion in general.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>k<span class="small">&#224;</span>nr<span class="small">&#224;</span>n</i> is an energy tied in with twin births, the sensual and the erotic. We see this in how <i><span class="small">&#7885;</span>m<span class="small">&#250;</span></i> (the female breast) came to earth, not with the sole purpose of feeding infants, but also to be caressed and to <span class="small">&#8216;</span>enjoy life.<span class="small">&#8217;</span> <span class="small">&#7884;</span>m<span class="small">&#250;</span> went for divination before coming to earth and was told that she would do well to attach herself to woman exclusively, and that if she made the necessary sacrifice she would not only be given the gift of nurturing infants, but would also be adored, caressed, cherished and admired. She complied with the diviner<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s recommendation and so it was that the breasts became a source of pleasure, lust and satisfaction. The principle of seduction is found in one story recounted by P<span class="small">&#243;</span>p<span class="small">&#243;</span><span class="small">&#7885;</span>l<span class="small">&#225;</span> (2008:554), and in a different rendering in Osamoro (1986:142), in which it is portrayed as a power related to snakes. The story speaks of N<span class="small">&#236;</span>n<span class="small">&#236;</span>, the daughter of Boa Constrictor, who was amazingly beautiful and even more seductive. She decided to put her charm and beauty to use, and became notorious for her skills in seduction. She was not interested in keeping a man for marriage, for her seduction was just about conquest, and man after man fell for her beauty and charm. She just wanted to be adored. One day she went to the local diviner to see how she could become even more seductive and beautiful, but the <i>awo</i> told her that it was time for her to change her ways before it got too late for her to have a man and children. But she was not interested in that, and saw his recommendation as a judgment on her free and easy way of life. Beside this, she was a very fertile woman and was constantly pregnant with someone<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s child. As she rarely knew who the father was and also because she didn<span class="small">&#8217;</span>t want a child, she used her herbal skills to end pregnancy after pregnancy, venereal affliction after venereal affliction. Time passed, and sure enough, the moment came when she wanted to settle down and have children, but it was too late. All the strong herbs which she had used over the years had left her barren, and she had difficulties in finding a man who would stay with her. Eventually she found one, but no love, and life was a lonely journey for her.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_228"></a>It follows that we find here herbs of venereal properties and also abortive ones, and the <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> also comes with advice to take care in using and administrating them.</p>
<p class="indent">The story recounted by Osamoro Ibie is a different one, but with the same idea, a beautiful serpentine wife, who refuses offspring in favour of maintaining her seductive powers. And here an If<span class="small">&#225;</span> poem is quoted that reads:</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent"><i>A snake begets a snake</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>Like a witch begets a witch</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>From its mother<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s womb</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>The snake inherits the venom sac</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>Just as the witch sucks</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>Witchcraft from the mother<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s bowels</i></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This poem brings woman, snakes, witchcraft and the power of seduction together into an important principle of <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>. In so doing, it emphasizes the importance of carefully assessing those we keep company with. Like <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>k<span class="small">&#224;</span>nr<span class="small">&#224;</span>n</i>, it has much to say about the quality of woman and how erratic a woman can be, because she is a force of nature in touch with the ancestral mothers. Those who one verse describes as <span class="small">&#8216;</span>liberated women, who are like tornadoes<span class="small">&#8217;</span> are not to be blamed for their behavioural pathology. Rather, if a man is experiencing problems with his wife, he either made a poor choice (i.e. he married someone not compatible) or he is demonstrating his incapacity to placate and appease her. This makes reference to Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span>lal<span class="small">&#224;</span>, <span class="small">&#204;</span>y<span class="small">&#224;</span>m<span class="small">&#237;</span> and <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>nil<span class="small">&#233;</span> as powers of possible devastation which are constantly appeased, venerated and cherished.</p>
<p class="indent">The same point is made in another story that speaks of how <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>k<span class="small">&#224;</span>nr<span class="small">&#224;</span>n</i> married a very beautiful, very talented but very jealous woman, namely Od<span class="small">&#249;</span>, but his patience, care and love tamed her jealousy</p>
<p class="indent">Twin births are prominent in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i>, which are related to <span class="small">&#7864;</span>d<span class="small">&#250;</span>n, the Columbus monkey, that came to earth as a beautiful and serene woman. She experienced problems in becoming pregnant, but with the help of If<span class="small">&#225;</span> and herbs, she became fertile and gave birth to several pairs of twins. Twins are related to the mystery of <span class="small">&#7864;</span>gb<span class="small">&#x00eb;</span>, the society in heaven, where our double resides while we undertake our human journey. In essence, we are all twins, as <i><span class="small">&#232;</span>n<span class="small">&#236;</span>y<span class="small">&#224;</span>n</i> is the reflection of the heavenly double. This metaphysical condition can lead to good <a id="page_229"></a>guidance as much as it can lead to the phenomenon known as <i><span class="small">&#224;</span>b<span class="small">&#237;</span>ku</i>, infant death syndrome. <i><span class="small">&#192;</span>b<span class="small">&#237;</span>ku</i> means <span class="small">&#8216;</span>born to die,<span class="small">&#8217;</span> and signifies a state in which the human being is constantly being called back to his or her <span class="small">&#7864;</span>gb<span class="small">&#x00eb;</span> in heaven, thus bringing the human journey to an early conclusion. Since the human experience is seen as a field of teaching and a blessing, it is important to make the necessary sacrifice in order to establish a pact with the <span class="small">&#7864;</span>gb<span class="small">&#x00eb;</span> in <span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>run so that the child may stay on earth and complete its journey. Monkeys represent the presence of the supranatural in the world, a mystery that goes deep within the secrets of <i>eg<span class="small">&#250;</span>ng<span class="small">&#250;</span>n</i>.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>k<span class="small">&#224;</span>nr<span class="small">&#224;</span>n</i> is an <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> that speaks of <span class="small">&#8216;</span>heaven upon earth<span class="small">&#8217;</span> as much as it speaks of the condition of the world at large. Many stories in this <i>od<span class="small">&#249;</span></i> use allegories related to chickens and roosters to describe this marketplace we know as our world, in particular when showing how fertile it is. It here that the melancholy Rooster made sacrifice in order to find a good spouse, and he did indeed find Hen.</p>
<p class="indent">However, it is also here that we find the ants making sacrifice so that they can freely bring destruction and devastation on households by taking and consuming what they want. Dogs are important here too, as guides, friends and protectors. But above all, we find the concept of <i>funfun leke</i>, the wind, manifesting in all her forms, such as the tornado (<span class="small">&#7884;</span>ya) Ay<span class="small">&#233;</span>lal<span class="small">&#224;</span>, the sum of the ancestral mothers.</p>
<p class="indent">In <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>k<span class="small">&#224;</span>nr<span class="small">&#224;</span>n</i> we find all the sadness in the world. We find the idea of enmity in the presence of snakes and the arrogant attitudes of people. We find the dark side of ambition and power, and death at the end of the rope given by <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i>. <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>k<span class="small">&#224;</span>nr<span class="small">&#224;</span>n</i> is the darkness that calls upon the light, the misfortune that insists on fortune, the bitterness that reminds us to go out and seek honey.</p>
<p class="indent"><i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>k<span class="small">&#224;</span>nr<span class="small">&#224;</span>n</i> is Lamurudu<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s (the biblical Nimrod<span class="small">&#8217;</span>s) tower of Babel as much as it is the spirit of any renaissance or renewal. <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>k<span class="small">&#224;</span>nr<span class="small">&#224;</span>n</i> is truly about what comes from the heart, as we realize that we are the authors of our own misfortune and fortune. <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>k<span class="small">&#224;</span>nr<span class="small">&#224;</span>n</i> assumes that we are the general of the legion of souls that makes us who we are. A good general sees only situations, and exploits their possibilities to his or her benefit, in order to achieve victory.</p>
<p class="indent">In <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>k<span class="small">&#224;</span>nr<span class="small">&#224;</span>n</i>, we find confusion brought on by lack of understanding, and by the nature of language; we find the accumulation of the wickedness initiated in <i><span class="small">&#x00d4;</span>b<span class="small">&#224;</span>r<span class="small">&#224;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i> through greed, ambition and wordly power; and we find <span class="small">&#7778;</span><span class="small">&#224;</span>ng<span class="small">&#243;</span> coming to earth to deal with this wickedness, and create space for the arrival of <i><span class="small">&#210;</span>g<span class="small">&#250;</span>nd<span class="small">&#225;</span> m<span class="small">&#233;</span>j<span class="small">&#236;</span></i>, which brings war, victory and clear roads.</p>
