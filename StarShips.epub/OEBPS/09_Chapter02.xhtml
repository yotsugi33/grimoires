<p class="indent" style="margin-top:2em;">Before we knew how to farm, before we lived in villages, before we even knew how to make pots, we built a star temple on a hill. The simplicity of this statement belies its astounding implications. With one motion it demolishes Childe&#x2019;s materialist analysis of the human journey. We did not build G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe in Southeastern Turkey because a surplus of stored food allowed a priestly class to emerge and tell us make-believe stories. We did not monitor the movements of the stars because it told us when to plant crops, because we weren&#x2019;t planting crops.</p>
<p class="indent">We built G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe because it expressed something about ourselves and our place in the universe. The temple complex restores the quest for meaning to its preeminent place atop the goals of human life. Philosophy is rescued from being a mere nighttime hobby of farmers to being the defining human trait, that which we value most. This is what the site&#x2019;s discoverer, Dr Klaus Schmidt, means when he says that the cathedral predates the city. It may well have been the coming together for spiritual reasons that birthed settled cultures, rather than the other way around. We
<a id="page_18"></a>
may literally state that mankind had civilising gods (for better or for worse!). G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe is probably the most important archaeological discovery of all time.</p>
<p class="indent">It is impossible to overestimate just how rare, just how precious such a find really is. There is barely any of Victorian London left a scant century of change later. G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe is <i>at least</i> twelve thousand years old. That is seven thousand years older than the Giza complex. The Great Pyramid is closer in time to us than it is to the creation of G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe. Writing in his <i>National Geographic</i> article, &#x2018;The Birth of Religion,&#x2019; Charles C. Mann says that, &#x2018;G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe was like finding that someone had built a 747 in a basement with an X-Acto knife.&#x2019;</p>
<p class="indent">Unlike other sources of pseudohistorical speculation &#x2013; such as selective interpretations of Sumerian tablets or the wilful misreadings of Mayan carvings bearing a squinting resemblance to 1960s space suits &#x2013; G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe, once seen, cannot be unseen. Its existence is a fact rather than an interpretation. A fact that has been easier to ignore than engage with over the last twenty years. Writing in &#x2018;Turkey: Archaeological Dig Reshaping Human History,&#x2019; an article for <i>Newsweek</i>, Patrick Symmes observes, &#x2018;the real reason the ruins at G&#x00F6;bekli remain almost unknown, not yet incorporated in textbooks, is that the evidence is too strong, not too weak. &#x201C;The problem with this discovery,&#x201D; as Schwartz of Johns Hopkins puts it, &#x201C;is that it is unique.&#x201D;&#x2019;</p>
<p class="indent">Uniqueness. The career academic&#x2019;s least favourite thing.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>AN UNCOMMON DISCOVERY</b></p>
<p class="indent">For G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe to even exist today requires a string of low-probability events so remarkable that you would be forgiven for calling it fate.</p>
<p class="indent">Firstly, the entire site was deliberately and delicately buried in 8200 <small>BC</small> after thousands of years of continual use. In terms of scale, this burial was a community project equal to or greater than G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe&#x2019;s original construction, with some 300 cubic metres per enclosure, so there must have been a very important reason behind it. In and of itself, the burial is highly unusual. You only need to drive past an abandoned church to see that changing belief systems result in the abandonment of places of worship or, only slightly less commonly, in iconoclasm. And while there is some suggestion of scattered iconoclasm at G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe and Karahan Tepe, one does not see old churches wrapped in bubble wrap.</p>
<p class="indent">The second event that spared G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe is the sheer weight of time. Although the region was probably continuously occupied, it would be more than four thousand years before the early Mesopotamian civilisations began large scale sacred building anywhere near there. To paraphrase Tolkien, history became legend, legend became myth, and for ten thousand years the rings of stone passed out of all knowledge. It is
<a id="page_19"></a>
just possible that there remains a cultural echo of this history/legend/myth continuum. Atop the mound of G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe is a <i>ziyaret</i>, a place of pilgrimage within the folk magic of the local cultures. In this case it is a single tree in an otherwise barren landscape, where locals will come to ask favours and leave small ribbons or offerings.</p>
<p class="indent">The final event that kept the site safe until its discovery by Dr Schmidt in October of 1994 was its misidentification as a graveyard, possibly a Byzantine or Muslim one, in 1963. Due to religious law, it is not permitted to disturb the remains of deceased Muslims. In that year, the site was first identified as Stone Age by American archaeologist, Peter Benedict. He missed that the entire hill he was standing on was man-made, referenced a graveyard but did not specify if it was modern or Byzantine, and then walked down off and away from the greatest archaeological discovery he would never make.</p>
<p class="indent">For three decades, G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe was relegated to a largely uninteresting entry in an aging site survey, until, in 1994, Dr Schmidt committed himself to visiting all known Stone Age sites in the area around Nevali &#x00C7;ori, a previously discovered Neolithic settlement nearby. He recognised what Benedict missed and has been excavating the site ever since.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>LOCATING G&#x00D6;BEKLI TEPE IN TIME AND SPACE</b></p>
<p class="indent">From the perspective of previous academic theories about the development of civilisation, we have seen that G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe should probably not exist. And from the perspective of the sheer volume of elapsed time between its creation and our modern age, we have seen that it should not have survived. This makes the site exceedingly rare.</p>
<p class="indent">With rarity comes the danger of overinflating the significance of a discovery, as if only the most important sites could have survived into the modern day. This may not always be the case. Someone has to win the lottery, after all, and winning does not confer retroactive significance on the lucky ticket holder. There may have been hundreds of sites like G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe stretching right across the Levant and Central Asia. Indeed, there are smaller temple sites in the same area, such as Karahan Tepe, which indicate that whatever cosmology expressed in the site design was at least locally distributed.</p>
<p class="indent">That being said, while the cosmology itself appears to have been widely dispersed, there is good evidence that G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe itself had higher status as a holy place within this belief system than any nearby sites, and so should be looked at most closely. This evidence comes principally from analysis on 130 obsidian samples from G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe by Tristan Carter of McMaster University.</p>
<a id="page_20"></a>
<p class="image"><a id="ch02fig2"></a><img src="images/f0020-01.jpg" width="100%" alt="Images"/></p>
<p class="fig"><a href="05_Illustrations.xhtml#rch02fig2"><i><span class="fig">fig. 2</span> G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe</i></a></p>
<a id="page_21"></a>
<p class="indent">Obsidian found in situ originated in multiple locations from up to 300 miles away, and is stylistically similar to objects found in Iraq and Iran. Whilst there is no way of knowing whether the artefacts were taken directly to G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe or form a fingerprint of a long-vanished trading network it is largely irrelevant in determining the status of the site. Either way the site was a hub, known throughout the land. And so we are placed in the situation of estimating the footprint of something non-physical, a belief system, by mapping it to the footprint of something physical; in this case an obsidian trading network. It is a supposition, to be sure, but a sound one. In any case, in an era that predates the written word by more than five thousand years, supposition &#x2013; <i>interpretation</i> &#x2013; is the best we are going to get.</p>
<p class="indent">G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe is located in the upper arc of what we now call the Fertile Crescent. To the north are forested mountains, to the east is the biblical plain of Harran and stretching away to the south are the storied lands of Mesopotamia. On a clear day you can see into modern Syria from its summit. About fifty kilometres to the south east is another temple complex of T-shaped pillars arranged in ovoid layouts called Karahan Tepe, which is three times smaller and, at last dating, several centuries younger than its more famous sibling.</p>
<p class="indent">A similar distance to the north is the settlement of Nevali &#x00C7;ori, which is almost a thousand years younger than the earliest layers of G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe and was flooded in 1992 during the building of the Ataturk Dam. It was not a temple but one of the world&#x2019;s oldest permanent settlements.</p>
<p class="indent">So G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe was in use before the beginnings of settled life and agriculture, and remained in use after Childe&#x2019;s &#x2018;Neolithic Revolution&#x2019; began in earnest. Here we come to a very important, &#x2018;blink and you missed it&#x2019; swapping out of fact and interpretation, the understanding of which is crucial for a magical analysis of the site. According to the preliminary excavation report for the 2013 season, calibrated dating on charcoal residue in some of the ring walls gives a date for their construction early in the tenth millennium <small>BC</small>. Given that only a minority of the site has been excavated, and shaped bedrock was discovered underneath one of the enclosures in the same season, Dr Schmidt will be the first to tell you that <i>the earliest evidence of usage is not evidence of first usage</i>. He has said on numerous occasions that he expects the date of first use to be pushed back even farther.</p>
<p class="indent">But even with the dating where it is, the earliest use of the site predates settled agriculture by centuries. Thus, any attempts to <i>interpret</i> the complex as &#x2018;a temple showing the transition from hunter-gathering to settled agriculture&#x2019; need to be seen for what they are: an academic attempt to claw G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe back inside their old model where savages cannot build and barbarians can. It softens the blow on their
<a id="page_22"></a>
belief system somewhat, because it moves the large-scale monument building into an era when people were already constructing things anyway, rather than having to face the evidence that humans clearly built things that were important to them long before the emergence of the agricultural economics typically used to &#x2018;explain&#x2019; such behaviour.</p>
<p class="indent">From a distance of twelve millennia out, five or more centuries does not look like a huge amount of time, so few people bat an eye when academics describe something as astonishing as G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe as belonging to a culture transitioning to settled, agricultural life. But this is like saying that the Gutenberg Press was created as part of our transition into the European Union. It is a nonsensical attempt to cling to the old interpretation despite the discovery of new, unambiguous facts.</p>
<p class="indent">No one is arguing that the latest stages of the complex do not post-date the adoption of agriculture, but this observation is being used to mask the fact that the earliest stages very much do not. The earliest stages of G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe &#x2013; the largest and most sophisticated stages &#x2013; are not the <i>beginning</i> of &#x2018;barbarism,&#x2019; they are <i>the very end of</i> &#x2018;savagery.&#x2019; Returning to the <i>Newsweek</i> article, we read, &#x2018;[t]he temples thus offer unexpected proof that mankind emerged from the 140,000 year reign of hunter-gatherers with a ready vocabulary of spiritual imagery, and capable of huge logistical, economic and political efforts.&#x2019;</p>
<p class="indent">Before anyone thinks of calling the by-now-ironically-named History Channel, the technical complexity of the site, whilst hugely impressive, is not in any way mysterious. In fact, that is one of the main points. In theory, humanity had the technical skill to construct the temple for tens of millennia before G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe was built, and this is but a very rare survival of it. You build G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe by hitting rocks with other rocks, then standing them up. No aliens required.</p>
<p class="indent">The anomaly is non-physical rather than physical: it is what this impressive complex reveals about the majesty and sophistication of the hunter-gatherer&#x2019;s inner landscape. As Johns Hopkins archaeologist Glenn Schwartz points out, this is the first time we see humans express the notion that they resemble gods. That has huge cosmological implications for how we view our distant past.</p>
<p class="indent">If V. Gordon Childe gave us some artificial horizons we should largely ignore, there are some very real physical ones we cannot. We often mistake a dearth of evidence for the cultural landscape of our hunter-gatherers for the belief that they probably did not have much of one. Large-scale ochre mining took place in Africa&#x2019;s Middle Stone Age over 100,000 years ago, and evidence of its use is still occasionally found dating before even that. However as professors Miranda and Stephen Aldhouse-Green, both of the University of Wales, Newport, point out in <i>The Quest for the Shaman</i>, art, once
<a id="page_23"></a>
painted on cave walls older than 30,000 years generally now survives only as collapsed fragments. We face an immovable temporal barrier beyond which it is largely impossible to see with the spectacles of archaeology.</p>
<p class="indent">Fortunately, there are other spectacles in the dedicated folklorist&#x2019;s toolkit which we shall come to in subsequent chapters. In the meantime, it is important to realise that we really have few ways of knowing just when this high complexity of non-physical technology began, given fully modern humans existed for at least 200,000 years before the &#x2018;Palaeolithic Consciousness Revolution&#x2019; we see beginning at Lascaux and culminating on a flint mound in South East Turkey. From a physical evidence perspective, we have a clearly defined palaeontological window.</p>
<p class="indent">In the satirical newspaper, <i>The Onion</i>, there is a popular article from more than a decade ago titled &#x2018;Archaeologist tired of unearthing unspeakable, ancient evil.&#x2019; While this is a comment on Hollywood depictions of the field, it has a curious real world analogue. Great archaeological discoveries often trigger western esoteric revolutions as their ontological implications disseminate into the wider culture. Samuel and Moina Mathers first met in the Egyptian Gallery of the British Museum, for instance, and it is unlikely the sixties counterculture would have looked the way it did without the mid-twentieth century anthropological research into American Indian beliefs. G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe falls into the trigger category. In many ways the site is a new Rosetta Stone. It sits right at the very edge of a way of life we have at least some frame of reference for: settled agriculture; and overlaps another way of life for which we have none: hunter-gathering. Thus, written in both a language we can understand and one that we cannot, it offers our first and best opportunity to unlock the mysteries of mankind&#x2019;s earliest and longest-lived culture. It is a key made of stone and starlight.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>SITE SURVEY</b></p>
<p class="indent">G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe is quite large, covering some nine hectares. Geophysical surveys suggest its total size may be more than thirty hectares. Prior to the construction of the temples, it was very likely a flint quarry used for the creation of spear and possibly arrow tips. This may be relevant in determining the nature of the gods and spirits that were eventually venerated there.</p>
<p class="indent">The site is characterised by two main layers. Layer II, the younger, reveals rectangular buildings and iconography that indicate that it belongs to the same culture as the nearby settlement of Nevali &#x00C7;ori. Whilst the story of mankind&#x2019;s first known settled towns is endlessly fascinating in and of itself, we shall not dwell on it for too long. Civilisation, such as it is, had begun in earnest by this point. It is what came before Layer II that I consider to be one of the most important battlegrounds in modern philosophy.</p>
<a id="page_24"></a>
<p class="image"><a id="ch02fig3"></a><img src="images/f0024-01.jpg" height="100%" alt="Images"/></p>
<p class="fig"><a href="05_Illustrations.xhtml#rch02fig3"><i><span class="fig">fig. 3</span> Level III Structures A &#x2013; D at G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe (after Schmidt)</i></a></p>
<a id="page_25"></a>
<p class="indent">The older, Layer III, includes all the circular and ovoid temples with large, T-shaped humanoid pillars facing into the middle where two larger T-shaped humanoid pillars appear. The central pillars face south to south east. Some of the pillars are set directly into the bedrock, others into a terrazzo-like floor. They are often very tall and thin, and thus quite unstable, perhaps another indication of their ritual significance and use which will be explored below. Layer III is definitively preagricultural, although the large number of sickles found at the site demonstrates that wild grains, probably for the brewing of beer, formed part of the culture&#x2019;s diet.</p>
<p class="indent">As only a minority of the hill has been excavated so far, it seems likely that there are around twenty of these early circular enclosures covering the top and southern face of G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe. Later circles are less than half the size of the earlier ones which has been interpreted as indicating that the culture was in decline in later years.</p>
<p class="indent">Each of the enclosures is named in the order of its discovery: Enclosure A, Enclosure B, and so on. The pillars are often carved in both high and low relief and some imagery is more common in one enclosure compared to the next. For instance, Enclosure A has more snake imagery than Enclosure B, which has more fox imagery.</p>
<p class="indent">The largest is Enclosure D. It has two very large central pillars and 12 smaller ones surrounding it. The central pillars are the best examples of the compelling T-shaped humanoid figures that characterise many of the pillars on the site. In this case they have long thin arms reaching around to the belly area, some form of neck adornment and belts with what is probably a fox skin covering the groin. The belts themselves have a curious buckle or symbol that looks like our capital H. The central pillars face south. They do not appear to have a discernable gender. According to the preliminary excavation report for the 2013 season, large volumes of charred botanical remains were found, offering the exciting possibility of further calibrating the date of use.</p>
<p class="indent">Just to the southeast is Enclosure C. It has several concentric, interwoven walls containing smaller T-pillars around the two large central ones, at least one of which was probably deliberately toppled in antiquity. The diameter of the entire enclosure is approximately 30 metres. Enclosure C&#x2019;s floor is of cut, smoothed bedrock, out of which were also carved the 30 cm pedestals for the two large T-pillars. Described in the same preliminary report is the discovery that Enclosure C was changed substantially during its use. A south-facing entrance passage consisting of two narrowly-set walls entering into the larger, outer circle via what is described as a portal stone. At some point, this passageway was deliberately <i>walled up</i>. In 2012, a carved stairway was discovered at the entry-point of the passageway. Although the passage points almost due south, Enclosure C&#x2019;s central pillars point slightly more south-southeast, offering the suggestion that the temple&#x2019;s principal sacred axis has changed over time.</p>
<a id="page_26"></a>
<p class="h3"><b>IMAGERY ANALYSIS</b></p>
<p class="indent">It is not just the conspicuous absence of any farmed animals in the large volumes of bones and detritus used as fill for the enclosures that tells us this is a hunters&#x2019; temple, it is also the imagery.</p>
<p class="indent">Around half of the pillars so far excavated feature some astonishing relief carvings. The majority of the imagery depicted in Layer III relates to prey, alpha predators or otherwise dangerous animals, such as scorpions and snakes. You would not leave your children with any of the animals found on this hill. From the outset, we can see that G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe is not an example of &#x2018;primitive sympathetic magic,&#x2019; designed to ensure a successful hunt. (I would argue that such an exclusive interpretation is largely incorrect anywhere in the Palaeolithic, but that is a separate issue.) Sources of food such as the aurochs, wild ass, gazelle and boar &#x2013; in some instances depicted upside down &#x2013; can certainly be found. But there are also many foxes, lions, leopards, cranes, storks, ibises, vultures and what may well be a crocodile, a culinary delicacy for which Southeast Turkey is not exactly famous. More on that later.</p>
<p class="indent">Different imagery tends to predominate in different enclosures. For instance, foxes and snakes are most common in Enclosure D. Enclosure C has no snakes but a lot more boars. It is not unreasonable to suggest that each enclosure had a presiding animal spirit, perhaps even the totemic spirit of the family group who may have &#x2018;sponsored&#x2019; its construction. What has been described as a totem pole, carved with snakes and topped with birds, has been found in the northeast corner of a room in Layer II, so the interpretation may have merit.</p>
<p class="indent">The majority of the site&#x2019;s imagery is carved in low relief, although there are some exceptional examples of high relief carvings that Dr Schmidt has interpreted as &#x2018;temple guardians.&#x2019; So far, all high relief depictions have been of &#x2018;ferocious&#x2019; animals rather than game, lending credence to the hypothesis. In both cases, it is important to emphasise that the imagery is created by taking a larger stone and <i>carving off everything around the depiction</i>. With the pillars that include high relief sculptures, this means starting with a considerably larger piece of rock. Make a mistake and start again. These were not the idle scratchings of superstitious minds, they were planned inclusions from the very outset, and so were clearly weighty with meaning.</p>
<p class="indent">The high relief carvings tell us something else important, and that is that the eerie, quasi-human feel of the central T-pillars was a deliberate stylistic choice. They were not the crude attempts of a culture struggling with accurate depictions of their kings or chiefs. Some frankly very beautiful examples of stylistic naturalism can be found at G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe, even down to the individual carving of teeth and tusks. Those giant, faceless, thin-armed humanoids with jointed fingers, wearing fox-pelt over their belts
<a id="page_27"></a>
with H-shaped buckles and strange neck charms, hovering in the centre of the sacred space are <i>supposed</i> to look like that. It almost makes you want to sleep with the light on.</p>
<p class="indent">It is worth considering the preponderance of snake depictions at some length. In at least once instance, the snakes are interwoven into a grid or mat, which is highly suggestive of the ectopic phenomena first seen when an entheogen begins to take effect. Indeed, ayahuasca, for instance, is often depicted as a female snake spirit. Geometric patterns coalesce into snakeskin, which coalesces into a giant snake and then the rest of the journey begins in earnest. Other single snakes are depicted crawling up the back or the side of the T-pillars. In Nevali &#x00C7;ori &#x2013; which is a later settlement than Layer III &#x2013; fully anthropoid statues were found with a snake climbing up the spine, over the top of the human head, with the snake&#x2019;s head ending in the centre of the forehead. The extremely high degree of similarity between this statue and both the Ancient Egyptian Uraeus and the Kundalini cannot be ignored.</p>
<p class="indent">In fact, in light of Nevali &#x00C7;ori&#x2019;s twentieth century discovery, it is worth bearing in mind that the land surrounding it during its occupation, with verdant grasslands, pistachio trees, einkorn wheat, oak, elm, wild sheep, pigs and cattle is an exact match for descriptions found in India&#x2019;s oldest religious texts, the Rig Veda. It is descriptions such as these that definitely rule out an exclusively Indian origin for Vedic culture &#x2013; to which we will return in later chapters &#x2013; but is presented here to demonstrate the strong circumstantial evidence of a continuity of cosmologies.</p>
<p class="indent">The possibility that G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe was a site of ritualised drug use is one that Dr Schmidt thinks is highly likely. Rectangular pits that were likely used for the brewing of beer &#x2013; discussed below &#x2013; have already been found on site and similar locations. Mandrake beer is known in Ancient Egypt from the legend of Sekhmet, where her consumption of it &#x2013; as a proxy for human blood, no less &#x2013; transformed her into the benevolent Hathor, &#x2018;the giver of life&#x2019; after a drug-induced sleep. (The Old Arabic term for mandrake is <i>Abu&#x2019; l-ruh</i>, &#x2018;master of the life breath.&#x2019;) It was also added to wine in Bacchic rites. In both instances we have much later echoes of the securing of immortality or transformation via an entheogen-induced shamanic journey.</p>
<p class="indent">None of this rules out the possibility that other, more traditional, shamanic allies were used. Along the top of the western side of the famous Pillar 43 in Enclosure D &#x2013; the largest enclosure &#x2013; are a sequence of images that look like three modern padlocks in profile. Graham Hancock refers to these as, &#x2018;the shaman&#x2019;s manbags.&#x2019; But it is the carvings below these manbags that lend the interpretation credence.</p>
<p class="indent">Immediately below the manbags and at the base of the pillar are depictions of several cranes. The crane, like the ibis, is the shamanic animal <i>par excellence</i>, because it occupies the three worlds of land, water and air, moving seamlessly between them at will. Thoth, appearing fully-formed at the very beginning of Dynastic Egypt, is probably one example of the civilisational development of this intermediary, wisdom-imparting being. In other enclosures, dozens of smaller cranes are carved around the edges of the bases in which the central T-pillars stand. This animal is in some way involved in the comings and goings of presiding spirits of these temples, and quite possibly the humans who use it as well.</p>
<a id="page_28"></a>
<p class="image"><a id="ch02fig4"></a><img src="images/f0028-01.jpg" height="90%" alt="Images"/></p>
<p class="fig"><a href="05_Illustrations.xhtml#rch02fig4"><span class="fig">fig. 4</span> <i>Pillar 43, G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe</i></a></p>
<a id="page_29"></a>
<p class="indent">To the right of the large crane at the base of Pillar 43, although damaged, is a carving of a headless human with an erect penis. In between the small human at the base of the statue and the cranes and manbags at the top is a large scorpion and &#x2013; in what is the largest carving yet found at the site &#x2013; a large vulture or vulture/human therianthrope carrying a circular shape in its wing. Although some interpretations suggest this could be the sun, it is quite small and there is a headless human at the base of the pillar, so it is probably better understood as a head. Esoterically, it could be both, of course.</p>
<p class="indent">The combination of the bird &#x2013; most often the vulture &#x2013; and the head is repeated several times throughout the entire site. During the 2012 season, a larger-than-lifesize, realistic human head in the talons of a large bird was discovered in a deep sounding trench in the main excavation area. This is an image that is well-known from Nevali &#x00C7;ori and is thus highly suggestive of the continuation of &#x2018;headlessness&#x2019; and the special significance of the head from the deep Palaeolithic into the post-agricultural era. Other carved heads have been discovered in the fill of various enclosures, and are curiously evocative of some comparatively nearby cultic practices in Jericho, &#x2018;Ain Ghazal and Tell Aswad, where human skulls were removed from corpses and given new faces made from gypsum plaster before being installed in ancestral shrines. As far back as 26,000 years ago (doubling the distance between G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe and us), graves where the skulls have been painted with red ochre are found. From the same era, the Gravettian graves &#x2013; found across Europe &#x2013; often contain headless skeletons or sometimes just skulls.</p>
<p class="indent">Let us not forget that the central pillars are themselves headless in a sense. In place of a skull and face, the deliberate stylistic decision was made to carve a narrow rectangular prism. Whatever these beings are, they are human<i>ish</i>, but decidedly not human in scale or appearance despite the artistic capacity to depict both being found at the site. They display neither gender nor race. And separating your head from your body seems to please them.</p>
<p class="indent">Returning to the possibility that G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe may function as a Rosetta Stone, the metaphor of the mangrove swamp is useful. The mangrove swamp is where the unknown ocean of the Deep Palaeolithic <i>overlaps</i> with the recognisable land of settled
<a id="page_30"></a>
agricultural life. It is both places and neither. The twenty thousand years of entheogenic, ritualised shamanism between the Lascaux Caves and G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe &#x2013; the longest-running psychological experiment in the history of mankind &#x2013; are evidenced in the spiritual practices found on this flint hill in modern Turkey.</p>
<p class="indent">Quite what it was these practices made contact with may also be in evidence. &#x2018;Twenty years ago everyone believed civilization was driven by ecological forces,&#x2019; Schmidt told <i>National Geographic</i>. &#x2018;I think what we are learning is that civilization is a product of the human mind.&#x2019;</p>
<p class="h3"><b>ASTROTHEOLOGY</b></p>
<p class="indent">Dr Schmidt has referred to the T-pillars as &#x2018;a gathering of heavenly beings.&#x2019; Despite some of them weighing in at over five tonnes, the extremely narrow &#x2018;feet&#x2019; of the central T-pillars, resting in very shallow bases of only a few inches, give the curious impression of beings just barely landing on the ground.</p>
<p class="indent">Invisible from below, many of the tops of the T-pillars have &#x2018;cup marks&#x2019; facing up to the sky, like those found in much later Neolithic sites across Britain, as well as in Southern India, Sulawesia, Korea and Japan. K. P. Rao of the University of Hyderabad has correlated some of the Southern Indian cup marks with constellations such as Orion and Ursa Major. In the case of G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe, I suspect these may have been filled with a liquid that could reflect and catch the starlight as in a mirror but that is my <i>interpretation</i> of the <i>fact</i> of their existence. (In later eras, it was quite common to &#x2018;catch&#x2019; starlight in liquid.) Combined with the fundamental structural unsoundness of tall, narrow, heavy pillars resting precariously on carved bases, the existence of the cup marks suggests the enclosures were open to the night sky. Nothing resembling roofing has yet been found in the fill, but this may change as excavations continue.</p>
<p class="indent">The smaller, surrounding pillars facing into the central ones most commonly number twelve, but sometimes only ten. The number twelve, combined with images of the scorpion, the lion, the aurochs, some kind of reptile/dragon, the vulture and so on make it hugely tempting to leap to a zodiacal explanation for the enclosure&#x2019;s arrangement.</p>
<p class="indent">Perhaps this is so, but it is certainly more prudent to refer to G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe as a &#x2018;proto-zodiac.&#x2019; Evidence of star lore and even, according to one NASA study, solar plasma events such as the Northern Lights, are indicated in Palaeolithic cave paintings in Europe and Australia. Star lore is extremely old, astrology significantly less so. G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe is probably our earliest evidence (so far) of attempting to cohere many pieces of star lore into a unifying cosmology, but you still cannot determine your natal chart with it. We see star lore with Dr Doniger&#x2019;s telescope, we see astrology with her
<a id="page_31"></a>
microscope. It is a recipe for madness to confuse the two, one that is not helped by the fact that it is a Greek word with no Egyptian or Babylonian cognates. Precisely when star lore becomes astrology is largely a matter of opinion.</p>
<p class="indent">There is a common misconception that the Ice Age was wet, cold and snowy. Certainly, it would have been cold in Northern Europe but, at the time, a huge amount of the planet&#x2019;s water was locked up in glaciers and polar ice caps, so it was actually quite dry for much of the earth. Twenty thousand years of coming up on mushrooms under a canopy of stars undimmed by light pollution, industry or high atmospheric moisture can only have generated a profound and complex cosmology. It was the only show in town, after all, and you and I will never see it performed the way our ancestors did. We have mistaken the absence of evidence for the evidence of absence of Palaeolithic star lore and G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe appears, on the last page of a very long book, to correct that mistake.</p>
<p class="indent">As to the suggestion of solar influences at G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe, this interpretation is vanishingly weak. Firstly, why would non-agriculturalists care about the sun? Secondly, the enclosures are not circular, they are ovoid or womb-shaped. But perhaps most importantly, it is the north/south axis &#x2013; with a particular emphasis on the south &#x2013; that predominates over the east/west axis found in solar-aligned complexes. The pre-eminence of the sun in our earliest spiritual beliefs has been grossly over-inflated thanks largely to nineteenth century antiquarianism and the assumption that our ancestors were stupid enough to fear and misunderstand this bright object in the sky. G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe restores the star goddess and her children to their thrones.</p>
<p class="indent">Now we come to the potential alignments themselves. All the Layer III enclosure entrances and central T-pillars face south to southeast. It is reasonable to suggest that we should look in that corner of the night sky for the principal asterism. This does not preclude the presence of asterisms in other corners of the sky being represented, of course. Indeed, if this is a stellar temple it stands to reason that they probably were. Completely covered by a northeast wall of a rectangular room from the later Layer II, a totem pole reminiscent of those found in North America was discovered with what is probably a bear at its top. The northeast corner of the night sky contains Ursa Major, or the Bear. So it is possible that the association between this particular site and the stars was long-lived.</p>
<p class="indent">Returning to Layer III, the fact remains that the earliest enclosures all point to a highly resonant corner of the sky, so it is there that we shall look. There is also the fact that the oldest temples are on top of the tell (&#x2018;hill&#x2019;) and the younger ones move further down the south face. We would not expect this from a site whose principal direction was anything other than &#x2018;southish.&#x2019;</p>
<a id="page_32"></a>
<p class="indent">The entry &#x2018;portals&#x2019; to the central ellipses do not all point in the same direction, but rather drift from a general southerly one with the earliest temple, to a more southest direction for the later ones. It needs to be borne in mind that each enclosure was deliberately buried before the next one was constructed (or thereabouts). It occurred to Boston University geologist Dr Robert Schoch that the directional change may have been caused by the results of precession. Reconstructing the night sky during the time the enclosures were in use, he noted that:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">On the morning of the vernal equinox circa 10,000 <small>BCE</small>, before the sun rose due east at G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe, the Pleiades, Taurus, and the top of Orion were in view in the direction indicated by the central stones of Enclosure D &#x2026; with Orion&#x2019;s Belt not far above the horizon as dawn broke (as seen from the best vantage points in the area). A similar scenario played out for the orientation of the central stones of Enclosure C in circa 9500 <small>BCE</small> and for Enclosure B in circa 9000 <small>BCE</small>. Enclosure A is oriented toward the Pleiades, Taurus and Orion on the morning of the Vernal Equinox circa 8500 <small>BCE</small>, but due to precessional changes, the entire belt of Orion no longer rose above the horizon before dawn broke. By about 8150 <small>BCE</small> the belt of Orion remained below the horizon at dawn on the vernal equinox. These dates fit well the time frame established for G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe on the basis of radiocarbon dating. Furthermore, Orion the constellation can be viewed as literally a torso in the sky with arms (but not legs), a headless hunter, similar to the iconography of the headless hunters represented by the central pillars of Enclosure D.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">Dr Giulio Magli, who we met in the last chapter via his analysis of the astronomical components to the Mithras story, has also performed an archaeoastronomic survey of G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe and reached a different conclusion. Although his contention is that an Orion correlation would lead to too high a date for the structure, this is a premature analysis given that only a minority of the site has been excavated, and Dr Schmidt fully expects the evidence for first use to be pushed further back &#x2013; his matching of the night sky to the date of Enclosure D as revealed in the preliminary report for the 2013 excavation season is closer than Dr Schoch&#x2019;s: 9300 <small>BC</small>. This is within one hundred years of the latest carbon dates and given there is an unavoidable fuzziness in both radiocarbon dating and reconstructions of the ancient sky, it is effectively a bull&#x2019;s eye.</p>
<p class="indent">At the latitude of G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe in 9300 <small>BC</small>, the night sky welcomed back a visitor that had not been seen for more than five thousand years. Sirius. The hunter&#x2019;s companion had returned.</p>
<a id="page_33"></a>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">As Sirius is a negative magnitude star, it is in principle visible just above the horizon; I will however allow in what follows as altitude of 1/2&#x00B0; (actually the horizon at the site estimated via satellite images looks flat towards the south-east). Then, it can be seen that the above azimuths match the rising azimuths of Sirius in the following approximate dates:</p>

<p class="indent">The arc of sky covering Sirius/Canis Minor, Orion and then the Pleiades/Taurus has been a cultural focus for humans for tens of thousands of years. You can find them in Lascaux, you can also (possibly) see Orion in a 32,500 year old mammoth ivory carving found in Germany. Given the obvious symbolic parallels between Orion, the &#x2018;armed but headless&#x2019; T-pillars and the status of G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe as a hunters&#x2019; temple &#x2013; as testified by the fact that the feasting remains are exclusively wild taxa and the tell itself was used to mine flint &#x2013; it is reasonable to suggest that Dr Schmidt&#x2019;s &#x2018;heavenly being&#x2019; is represented by the asterism we call Orion.</p>
<p class="indent">How are we to square the better symbolic parallels with Orion with the more accurate (so far) astronomic parallels with Sirius? For magicians, this is almost self evident. The hunter had acquired a companion, the brightest star in the sky at that latitude, no less. This is a cosmological event worth memorialising, worth celebrating.</p>
<p class="indent">We have no way of knowing whether our ancestors saw Sirius as a female companion &#x2013; or even really if they saw Orion as male &#x2013; we only know that they are companions, two stellar beings appearing to chase Taurus across the sky just as the herds migrate across the planes below, and just as there are two pillars in the centre of each enclosure, an otherwise uncommon temple arrangement.</p>
<p class="indent">It is not yet a solid, but the plot has certainly thickened.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>RITUAL, FEASTING AND DEATH AT G&#x00D6;BEKLI TEPE</b></p>
<p class="indent">The role of food and drink on this particular tell needs to be explored at some length, as it attests to both the status and function of the site.</p>
<p class="indent">Firstly, there is no water source nearby capable of sustaining a permanent settlement and no evidence of food preparation or waste has been found to suggest that G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe was occupied year-round. It was a site of supreme importance, but not one that was built to live in. That being said, Dr Schmidt has recently conceded the temple may have had a guardian who had food and water delivered to him/her/them by passing tribes, but evidence for this has yet to be uncovered.
<a id="page_34"></a>
This is not to say there is no evidence of food consumption at G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe. Rather, there is too much of it. Large volumes of animal bones, smashed to get at the marrow, have been found in the backfill of the enclosures, in amounts exceeding everything known from other sites at the time. Here is a very strong indication that the tell was a place of regular pilgrimage for surrounding tribes and family groups.</p>
<p class="indent">The health of the animal bones also speaks to the sacred function of the site. In one of the more flimsy attempts to pull G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe back into line with the outdated paradigm, Karl W. Luckert of Missouri State suggests that the temple&#x2019;s grandeur and uniqueness was a sign of desperation; appealing to the gods of the hunt in the face of a changing climate and the disappearance of the herds. (He also suggests the T-pillars are upside down phalluses, penetrating the earth mother. The book is not recommended.)</p>
<p class="indent">However, in the introduction to Luckert&#x2019;s own book, Dr Schmidt &#x2013; wasting only one sentence before announcing his complete disagreement with the theory presented therein &#x2013; mentions that the end of the Ice Age was a period of superabundance for this particular corner of Asia Minor. Rainfall increased, grasslands spread, herds grew. We see this reflected in the health of the feasting bones. The ritual attendees at G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe were not a hungry people.</p>
<p class="indent">We see a similar attempt to pull the earliest stages of the site back into a paradigm that allows anthropologists who have been teaching the wrong thing for forty years to continue doing so, in the suggestion that the site was a roofed, domestic dwelling. Such analysis ignores the complete absence of domestic waste found at the site, the fundamental instability of the central pillars for housing, the absence of roofing, the lack of water and the ritualistic burial and replacement of each enclosure. Also, contemporaneous dwellings are rectangular rather than elliptical, as we see at Nevali &#x00C7;ori &#x2013; a site that also contains separate sacred and domestic structures. The interpretation relies solely on the straw man suggestion that hunter gatherers did not recognise a difference between the physical and the sacred, so these were houses in which they also maybe conducted rituals. The non-separation between the physical and the spiritual may be so, but you will also not find a single hunter gatherer society lacking in taboo areas, that is, spaces demarcated as belonging to the spirits rather than the tribe. It is imperative that a domestic reading of G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe be recognised for the academic gerrymandering that it is, and banished with laughter.</p>
<p class="indent">Risky though it is, a comparison with a much more recent hunter gatherer culture may be illuminating. The Boorong of Southeast Australia waited for Otchocut, the giant fish, to set with the sun. They then moved north to the Mille river, upon the banks of which their cousins dwelled.</p>
<a id="page_35"></a>
<p class="indent">Otchocut&#x2019;s sunset alignment coincided with the cod returning to the river to spawn. Travelling at night, ancestral and totemic spirit constellations would pass overhead, from east to west. Like many sophisticated hunter gatherer cultures, Boorong law required exogamy, or marrying outside the tribe. And so, on the banks of the Mille, families would reunite, celebrate, compete at spear-throwing, feast and arrange weddings. In the evenings, the young warriors would attempt to out-dance each other. As Alex Cherney and John Morieson point out in their paper at the 2010 conference of the La Soci&#x00E9;t&#x00E9; Europ&#x00E9;enne pour l&#x2019;Astronomie dans la Culture:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">The Boorong might stay for several weeks especially if there was ceremony to take place, such as first initiation for boys or girls. By now the full heat of summer was upon them so on their journey home to proceed at night was the only option. If the northern sky was a progression from east to west, the southern sky was a revolving scene where all the named ancestral heroes were visible for all the time, but sometimes hidden in the treetops. Bunya the possum was very evident at the top of the Southern Cross and every woman&#x2019;s totem, Yerredetkurrk, the owlet nightjar, is directly opposite in what we call Achernar. Halfway between the two is south so all the Boorong had to do was to keep in line with the halfway point and in three to four days they would be home.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">It is unlikely the family groups of Asia Minor arrived at G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe expecting cod. What we have with the Boorong is a proof of concept that star lore can be used to guide disparate populations to a specific site for a multitude of spiritual and practical reasons. Certainly, there would have been the same need for exogamy, as we were not even living in villages at the time, so inbreeding would have been a constant risk.</p>
<p class="indent">There is even the indication for dancing, or at least music, being important at G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe. Firstly, and most astonishingly, the central T-pillars hum. If you slap some of them with the palm of your hand, they vibrate like a tuning fork, thus probably uncovering the reason for their extremely shallow bases and otherwise flimsy height and width. Considered in conjunction with the stone walls that form the ellipses of smaller pillars, the mind moves inevitably to an amphitheatrical effect of chanting, drumming and dancing, both people and &#x2018;heavenly beings&#x2019; vibrating together with the sacred sound. Throw in the night sky, firelight casting dancing shadows of animal totems, the smell of roasted game and the suggestion of ritual intoxication and the whole place starts to sound &#x2026; well &#x2026; really quite fun.</p>
<p class="indent">Uncovered at nearby Nevali &#x00C7;ori and dating to a few centuries later are fragments of a limestone bowl depicting two persons with raised arms. Between them, a therianthropic
<a id="page_36"></a>
turtle joins in the dance, as Oliver Dietrich suggests, &#x2018;maybe reflecting the altered state of consciousness of the dancers.&#x2019; Turtles, like crocodiles, are not exactly endemic in Southeast Turkey.</p>
<p class="indent">The sonic qualities of Neolithic temples have been gaining wider awareness these past few years. The bluestones of Stonehenge &#x2018;sing&#x2019; when hit with rocks. In Western European tombs and mounds, resonances tend to cluster around the 110&#x2013;122 Hertz range, the same as a baritone voice. Maltese temples &#x2013; currently considered Neolithic though very likely Palaeolithic in origin &#x2013; provide similar results. Like astronomy, a scientific understanding of sound has typically fallen outside the more humanities-focused interpretations of ancient history. The implications of these Palaeolithic capacities are astounding and cry out to be explored, both personally and academically.</p>
<p class="indent">In the last few years, fragments of human bone have been found in niches behind some of the smaller, surrounding pillars. This opens up the intriguing possibility that G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe was used as a platform for excarnation. (I also suspect these surrounding pillars may represent individual tribal or family groups that convened at the site; Palaeolithic heraldry, if you will.) The preponderance of vulture imagery adds further weight to an excarnatory function. Excarnation is a post-mortem practice that has been used across Central Asia since the Neolithic and even survives to the modern day in the form of Tibetan &#x2018;sky burials.&#x2019; I depart from Dr Schmidt&#x2019;s analysis that the presence of human bones means G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe was the site of a death cult. Funerals are held in churches, but churches have other functions. If the enclosures were portals to another world, principally one located <i>above</i> the earth, they would be excellent locations in which to dispose of highborn members of family groups or tribes &#x2013; having the aviary ambassadors of the spirit realm carry the departed back up into the sky &#x2013; but it seems to me a death cult would be associated with a lot more human remains than the fragments so far discovered. That being said, it is entirely reasonable to suggest one of G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe&#x2019;s primary magical functions related to crossing the mortem/post-mortem threshold. Deliberately smashed T-pillars are found buried, entire enclosures are also buried. Such ritual activity has an exact parallel in Sumeria, five thousand years later. The Mosaic Temple in Uruk &#x2013; itself built over an earlier Ubaid temple &#x2013; was demolished and ritually buried in the nearby <i>Riemchengeb&#x00E4;ude</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">Despite such a lengthy gap, there are other architectural parallels. At Nevali &#x00C7;ori and Cay&#x00F6;n&#x00FC;, just as in Sumerian Mesopotamia, sacred structures were located at the edge of settlements, with later additions being built on top of earlier ones. As Dr Hauptmann points out, &#x2018;strikingly throughout the long course of Mesopotamian prehistory that covers a period between 6000 <small>BC</small> and 4500 <small>BC</small> from Hassuna to Halaf, it has not been possible to identify a definite ritual structure.&#x2019; What this means is that,
<a id="page_37"></a>
although the time gap is quite large, there are no immediately obvious intervening layers. We suggest that if Dr Hauptmann wishes to find them, he should both dig deeper at existing sites and rent some <small>SCUBA</small> gear.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>BEER AND NETWORK EFFECTS</b></p>
<p class="indent">The complete absence of domesticated foodstuffs at G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe takes on a new dimension when you realise that large scale cereal production was taking place just over the modern day border with Syria at a place called Jerf el Ahmar in the tenth millennium <small>BC</small>. Given that such a date precedes the currently-known development of agriculture in the region, the suggestion is the site was used for the large-scale preparation of wild, foraged grain such as rye and einkorn. No storage structures have been found at the earliest stages, which may indicate the facilities were used as a sort of &#x2018;inter-tribal cooperative.&#x2019; As Willcox and Stordeur point out, Jerf el Ahmar &#x2018;leave[s] no doubt that this was a community dedicated to the systematic production of food from wild cereals. Given the plausible suggestion that barley was being cultivated, the site opens a window onto a long period of pre-domestic agriculture. Rye was also harvested, its chaff used to temper mud walls.&#x2019;</p>
<p class="indent">Moving on to something much more interesting than communally baked rye bread, it appears mankind&#x2019;s relationship with alcohol is a lot older than we expected. It used to be that historians assumed wine was first created with the domestication of grapes, but following discoveries in Iran or wine residue in stone bowls at the Neolithic burial site of K&#x00F6;rtik Tepe &#x2013; also in Southeast Turkey &#x2013; we can now see that wine-making predates agriculture. From Dietrich: &#x2018;It can now be safely stated that people&#x2019;s first interest in wild grapes in western Asia was for alcohol production, evidence for domestication only following in the fourth millennium <small>BC</small>.&#x2019; Dionysus: born wild on the hills and plains that are home to the ruins of a Palaeolithic star cult.</p>
<p class="indent">Very large capacity limestone vessels, up to 160 litres, have been found at all levels of G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe. Oxalate residue &#x2013; which develops during the steeping, mashing and fermentation of cereals &#x2013; has been found on some of them. A complete scapula was found in one of them, which is reminiscent of finds in similar bowls in the Syrian site of Tell &#x2018;Abr 3. The bones may well have been used for stirring and scraping the surface of the liquid. (Bone beer, anyone?) As no signs of habitation have been found at G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe, Dietrich suggests that the grains used in beer production may have been malted at nearby settlements and brought to the complex on special occasions, an hypothesis that aligns perfectly with the interpretation that it was an episodic gathering place for nearby (and possibly quite distant) tribes sharing the same cosmology.</p>
<p class="indent">As we saw with the Boorong people, such regular gatherings provide for some
<a id="page_38"></a>
interesting network effects. Firstly, there are genetic ones in the form of arranged exogamy. Then there are the cultural and economic ones in the form of exchanges of information and practices. And finally, there may be technological ones, which is where G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe&#x2019;s story may become significant for the rest of human history.</p>
<p class="indent">Communal sites are vectors for the transmission of technology. We have already seen that the brewing of beer most likely predates the use of grain as a food staple, which only really took off following the development of agriculture. Once the domestication of wild grain had happened, it would have been at sites such as G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe that those who had worked this process out shared it with tribal groups who had yet to do so. Dietrich remarks, &#x2018;[i]t is an intriguing thought that brewing and the domestication of wheat might be interrelated.&#x2019;</p>
<p class="indent">Even more intriguing for the thesis of this book is a story told in the Sumerian &#x2018;Debate between Sheep and Grain.&#x2019; It describes the creation of domesticated livestock and plants and their delivery to mankind on a high place where the god of wild animals was still in residence.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">When, upon the hill of heaven and earth, An created the Annunaki, since he neither spawned nor created Grain with them, and since in the Land he neither fashioned the yarn of Uttu (the goddess of weaving) nor pegged out the loom for Uttu &#x2013; with no Sheep appearing, there were no numerous lambs, and with no goats, there were no numerous kids, the sheep did not give birth to her twin lambs, and the goat did not give birth to her triplet kids;</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">Upon the pure place known as Duku, Cattle and Grain were created. Before this moment, not even the Annunaki knew what they were, or had words for them.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">[T]he Annunaki, the great gods, did not even know the names Grain or Sheep. There was no grain of thirty days; there was no grain of forty days; there was no grain of fifty days; there was no small grain, grain from the mountains or grain from the holy habitations. There was no cloth to wear; Uttu had not been born &#x2013; no royal turban was worn; lord Ni&#x011D;ir-si, the precious lord, had not been born;</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">The god of the wild animals was still in residence, he had not been banished. At such a time, people had not clothing or houses and ate wild vegetation like sheep.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">The god of wild animals had not gone out into the barren lands. The people of those days did not know about eating bread. They did not know about wearing
<a id="page_39"></a>
clothes; they went about with naked limbs in the Land. Like sheep they ate grass with their mouths and drank water from the ditches.</p>
<p class="quotei">From the Holy Mound, domestication is sent down to mankind. At that time, at the place of the gods&#x2019; formation, in their own home, on the Holy Mound, they created Sheep and Grain. Having gathered them in the divine banqueting chamber, the Anunnaki of the Holy Mound partook of the bounty of Sheep and Grain but were not sated; the Anunnaki of the Holy Mound partook of the sweet milk of their holy sheepfold but were not sated. For their own well-being in the holy sheepfold, they gave them to mankind as sustenance.</p>
<p class="quotei">At that time Enki spoke to Enlil: &#x2018;Father Enlil, now Sheep and Grain have been created on the Holy Mound, let us send them down from the Holy Mound.&#x2019; Enki and Enlil, having spoken their holy word, sent Sheep and Grain down from the Holy Mound.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">Mythology is not history, but sometimes it is the vehicle in which history travels. Mythology is the wallpaper and history is the wall. A culture as decidedly pro-urban as Sumeria will necessarily have a negative view of preagricultural societies but it is extremely hard to argue that this story is anything but a cultural memory of humanity&#x2019;s transition to permanent settlements.</p>
<p class="indent">Where it becomes extremely compelling is that the transmission of grain-based agriculture happened at a holy mound upon which were resident sky beings and from which the god of the wild animals had not yet been banished. Beginning at this holy mound agricultural technology was disseminated across the world.</p>
<p class="indent">The ancient einkorn wheat, found in the hills surrounding G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe, just happens to be the single genetic ancestor of every strain of wheat grown and eaten across the earth. People gathering at a temple on a hill to worship &#x2018;heavenly beings&#x2019; were like passengers in an airport during a pandemic. Wheat, and what to do with it, spread to every corner of the land. Mankind had civilising gods who were themselves anything but civilised.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>THE CULT OF THE ANGELS</b></p>
<p class="indent">Fundamental to the exploration of this book is the question of what and how much may have survived across tens of millennia. If we see resonances between the spiritual practices of the tribes that convened at G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe but struggle to find intervening evidence, how are we to deal with this?</p>
<p class="indent">Returning to the concept of random versus non-random distribution of stories as described by Dr Oppenheimer, it is difficult to get any less random than the same
<a id="page_40"></a>
stories told in the same place. The mechanism for transmission thus becomes psychic or unconscious &#x2013; anathema for scientific materialism &#x2013; or it becomes a matter of continuous cultural memory. It may therefore be extremely significant that there <i>is</i> an example of continuous cultural memory overlaid in the same locations that gave us star temples on a hill, heavenly visitors and the dissemination of &#x2018;civilisational&#x2019; technology such as agriculture. And that is Yezidism.</p>
<p class="indent">According to former Harvard lecturer and world authority on the Kurds, Merhdad Izady, large amounts of Yezidi cosmology are actually Neolithic survivals.</p>
<p class="indent">Although the number of modern adherents is vanishingly small, such a long-lived religion has been in existence for enough time to have splintered into sufficient subsections that making macro statements is about as accurate as making macro statements about Christianity.</p>
<p class="indent">It can only really be said that three branches have survived from ancient times: Yezidism, Alevism and Y&#x00E2;rs&#x00E2;nism. All of them, however, past and present, share a fundamental belief in the existence of luminous angelic beings, numbering seven, that protect the universe from an equal number of dark beings who are the lords of matter. Similar to Hinduism, the cult is quite adaptive and universal, hybridising beings and philosophies encountered through either trade or migration, such as the transmigration of souls, emanatory creationism, Gnostic dual-<i>ish</i>-m and a cosmology that allows for the appearance on earth of world teachers such as Buddha, Jesus or Mohammed. The Yezidi branch even still retains vestiges of Mithraism, which is most noticeable in its festival calendar and corresponding rituals to do with perambulating bulls and communal feasting. Izady writes, &#x2018;[t]he Cult is fundamentally a non-Semitic religion, with an Aryan superstructure overlaying a religious foundation indigenous to the Zagros.&#x2019;</p>
<p class="indent">Mentioned by Herodotus, some Syrian and Turkish adherents of Alevism still maintain the rite of worshipping a deity represented by a sword stuck in the ground (which, to my eyes, looks rather like a T - pillar).</p>
<p class="indent">But it is the central Yezidi belief in Lucifer, Malak Tawus, as the world teacher and creator that is most suggestive of a very long-lived antiquity. Firstly, long before it was even a twinkle in History Channel&#x2019;s eye, we have a belief in celestial civilising beings. Secondly, the &#x2018;peacock angel&#x2019; is commonly represented as a bird sitting atop a totem pole. Sometimes it is a rooster. Both species are genetically south Asian and this is something we will return to in later chapters. We return to Izady:</p>

<p class="quote">The reverence of the Yezidis for divine manifestations in the form of a bird, the Peacock Angel, and the sacredness of roosters are just two better known examples. What is fascinating, but less well known, is that within 30 miles of the shrines of

L&#x00E2;lish are the Shanidar-Zawi Chami archaeological sites of central Kurdistan, where the archaeologist Solecki has unearthed the remains of shrines and large bird wings, particularly those of the great bustards, dated to 10,800 &#x00B1; 300 years ago. The remains are indicative of a religious ritual that involved birds and employed their wings, possibly as part of the priestly costume.</p>
<p class="quotei">The representation of bird wings on gods was later to become common in Mesopotamian art &#x2026; The evidence of sacrificial rites practiced at ancient Zawi Chami may substantiate an indigenous precursor to modern Yezidi practice &#x2026; In light of the discoveries at Zawi Chami, the great bustard is a much more likely bird of the Yezidi icon.</p>

<p class="indent">Izady&#x2019;s book, <i>The Kurds: A Concise History</i> was published several years before Dr Schmidt&#x2019;s discovery of G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe. As such, he was not to know that within the range of the great bustard &#x2013; the male of which is the earth&#x2019;s largest flying animal &#x2013; the precise same imagery of totem poles with birds, the verticality of sacred origin and even the therianthropic half-bird/half-man imagery was to be found stretching back another two thousand years. Izady could only pull the beginnings of Yezidism into the Neolithic because that was all that was known at the time. However, here is Dr Schmidt describing the deceptive horizon between the Palaeolithic and the Neolithic:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">I assume that since the late Palaeolithic at the latest, maybe even earlier, humans had religion. In my opinion, this is essentially indicated by evidence of burials, as after all providing a dead person with a grave, even with burial gifts, would hardly make sense without the spiritual background of the idea of an afterlife. A religion is not necessarily connected to the idea of a netherworld, but the existence of such an idea implicates the existence of a religion &#x2026;</p>
<p class="quotei">Thus, early Neolithic religion at about 10,000 <small>BC</small>, no matter its nature, is rather a product of a very ancient development and not a new creation. We may assume that since the days of old there were handed down myths or mythological motifs, even if we will hardly be able to provide any real evidence for their existence in preliterate societies, not to mention their contents.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">In much the same way that nearly one in two Americans believe that the world was created less than ten thousand years ago by an angry cloud man, while tweeting about these same beliefs on a slave-built device connected to hundreds of satellites orbiting the earth, it is a grievous interpretive error to assume technological change impacts belief systems at the same rate.</p>
<a id="page_42"></a>
<p class="indent">So, if parts of Yezidism are a Neolithic survival, then parts of it are actually a Palaeolithic survival, regardless of the subsequent appearance of towns and agriculture.</p>
<p class="indent">For the magician, the discovery of G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe at what was once believed to be the beginning of the human cultural story opens up vast new vistas on an era previously considered the domain of legend, with the tantalising possibility of exploring which parts of modern practice may be relics from this bygone age. For more than two thousand years, this era has been considered the home of true wisdom, <i>first</i> wisdom, the time before the Flood.</p>
