<p class="indent" style="margin-top:2em;">The further back in time we travel, the fewer the archaeological data points and the greater the desire to connect what little of them remain into parent-child relationships. It is quite clear that the gods of both Egypt and Sumeria are present at G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe, albeit in atavistic form. However, it does not necessarily follow that those tribes who buried the last enclosure immediately wandered south and founded two of the three great civilisations of antiquity. Mistaking resonance for <i>direct connection</i> has trapped many a magician in the garden maze of Choronzon&#x2019;s summer palace. The Laurasian model described in the previous chapter is our best interpretive framework for exploring these correlations.</p>
<p class="indent">When dealing specifically with physical evidence, it is essential to recognise just how rare these data points are and to realise that they hint at a much larger world of which we only have a fragment, then seek to build out a new, evidence-based world from this knowledge. Otherwise, you are a farmer who discovers a Roman coin in a field in Somerset and declares that the empire began right here by your apple trees.</p>
<a id="page_64"></a>
<p class="indent">More than any other error &#x2013; and there are so very many to choose from &#x2013; this is the mistake that has led most Atlantologists into madness and ridicule. The last century has shown that mankind indeed survived through a worldwide cataclysm when an area the size of Europe and China combined sank beneath the ocean. But at the moment there seem to be more lost continents than there are Starbucks. The cause of this error is understandable. As Dr Oppenheimer writes in <i>Eden in the East</i>:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">When breakthroughs like cereal farming, pottery and bronze making occur at the same time in widely separate regions, the usual explanation is that these discoveries were independent. This may seem a weak argument but for academics it is much safer to say this, rather than risk ridicule by having to prove how the inventions were transmitted over great distances. Theoretically, both points of view have an obligation of proof. The alternative hypothesis for the Neolithic Revolution &#x2013; and one which seems more plausible than the independent origins implied by the archaeological record &#x2013; is that farming technology was invented in one cultural region over a long period; knowledge of the innovation then spread to other continents by sea and land routes.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">So much for mainstream academia. The current state of affairs in independent or alternative research, populated with ridicule and shysters, is just as bad, if not worse.</p>
<p class="indent">This bifurcation into &#x2018;aliens&#x2019; in the alternative camp and &#x2018;nothing happened, move along&#x2019; in the mainstream camp was not always so. In fact, for the vast majority of western history, it was taken as fact that civilisation predated a worldwide sea-flood and was probably restarted by its few survivors. As the historicity of this state of affairs reemerges into the light, we learn that this notion &#x2013; in all likelihood a cultural memory &#x2013; was one of the babies thrown out with the bathwater of biblical Creationism. In one of the scientific method&#x2019;s first clashes with the incumbent priestly class, the notion of a worldwide flood, Noah&#x2019;s Flood, was dismissed as unscientific and so any civilisation destroyed by said flood must also be balderdash. This was a necessary casualty on the way to dethroning Creationism. It may have taken a hundred years, but geology is finally recovering from its combat wounds.</p>
<p class="indent">Along with geology&#x2019;s recovery has come the emergence of genetics as a means of tracking ancient population movements, and advances in linguistics as a means of tracking their complexity. After two millennia of mistaking mythology for history and following echoes of echoes of echoes of stories to points all over the planet, hoping that X marks the spot, we have never been in a better position to generate facts upon which we can overlay interpretations.</p>
<a id="page_65"></a>
<p class="indent">A perfect storm of prejudices and personal predilections has trapped the story of the Flood, and who it affected, for a long time. Atlantis is not Thera. Atlantis is not the marshlands near Valencia. Atlantis is not the Bimini Road. Atlantis is not the submerged harbour of Alexandria. Atlantis is a flood story, one of many. And flood stories turn out to have a decidedly nonrandom distribution.</p>
<p class="indent">The continent with the least flood stories is Africa, which just so happens to be the continent that suffered the least land loss at the end of the Ice Age. The area of the world with the most flood stories is Island Southeast Asia, home to more than half of all flood legends, which just so happens to be the part of the world that suffered the most land loss at the end of the Ice Age.</p>
<p class="indent">As to the assumption that islanders have more experience with sea floods and are thus bound to have more stories about them, this explanation is unsatisfactory and frankly racist. It assumes a fisherman in the Bismarck Archipelago cannot distinguish between a global cataclysm and the Easter tides. But just as with the Hawaiians and their words for rain, or the Eskimos and their words for snow, a Chuukese villager will forget more about the ocean after a night out on <i>sakau</i> than you or I will ever know in our lifetime. The human mind cannot see colours it does not have words for. There may be considerable accuracy in such a volume of flood stories, if we have the words to see them.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>AND DID THOSE FEET?</b></p>
<p class="indent">We will return to flood stories in the next chapter. In order to determine whether any of them constitute cultural memories, we must first examine what actually happened, and to whom.</p>
<p class="indent">There are some very specific reasons as to why the history of Island Southeast Asia and the nations of the Pacific are so little known. Firstly, these places are a long way from London and Amsterdam, two of the main trading centres that reincorporated these areas back into a global economy. Secondly, by the time it came to examining their stories, much of the singular narrative of &#x2018;world history&#x2019; was already written and so the evidence was shoehorned into a structure it simply did not fit, like a wicked stepsister&#x2019;s foot squeezing into a glass slipper. That is how we have ended up with the situation of tenured academics saying that the largest humans on earth &#x2013; the Polynesians &#x2013; descended from the probably the smallest &#x2013; the Taiwanese &#x2013; in a matter of a few centuries.</p>
<p class="indent">To suggest that this may have been wrong was to suggest that the story of East Asia was wrong, which was to suggest that the story of Western Asia and Europe and Africa was wrong. Picking up a different metaphor, the jigsaw of history was complete but
<a id="page_66"></a>
for one piece, the Pacific, which did not fit in the last remaining place. Better to smash it in and hope nobody noticed than admit the whole puzzle needs starting over.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, the safest way forward is to layer data from the hard sciences on top of each other and look for where they pile the highest, and only then invite interpretations of our unusual jigsaw piece from the Humanities end of the spectrum.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>GEOLOGY</b></p>
<p class="indent">The area of the earth that lost the most amount of land following the three separate sea level rises at the end of the Ice Age was Island South East Asia. Geologically, this entire region is now known as the Sunda Shelf, a formation of comparatively shallow seas off the Malay Peninsula and around Sumatra, Java and Borneo, making up part of the Asian continental shelf.</p>
<p class="indent">Looking east from Sundaland, there was a small, island-strewn ocean, housing Sulawesi, Timor and others, before the giant, connected continent of Australia and New Guinea, called the Sahul Shelf.</p>
<p class="image"><a id="ch04fig5"></a><img src="images/f0066-01.jpg" class="width564" width="564" height="391" alt="Images"/></p>
<p class="fig"><a href="05_Illustrations.xhtml#rch04fig5"><i><span class="fig">fig. 5</span> Sundaland and the Sahul Shelf</i></a></p>
<a id="page_67"></a>
<p class="indent">Between the last glacial maximum and the end of the Ice Age, it lost more than half its total land, an area greater than modern day India. Before then, it would have been a rather idyllic place, consisting largely of flat, grassy plains, sheltered river valleys and numerous pine forests. We think of the area now as warm, humid and tropical but it was only the northern half of Borneo that was &#x2018;everwet.&#x2019;</p>
<p class="indent">Perhaps significantly for any hypothetical development of an Ice Age culture, there were no large land predators &#x2013; such as sabre-tooth tigers &#x2013; for the early humans to contend with.</p>
<p class="indent">The sea between Sundaland and the Sahul Shelf was by no means a barrier. It may well have been something of a Palaeolithic Aegean. Evidence of fishing and aqua-culture dating back thirty thousand years has been found as far out as the Bismarck Archipelago. On Timor, one of the islands in this sea, a beautiful, 35,000 year old carved bone spear point was found. Sue O&#x2019;Connor, of the Australian National University, noted that its notches are almost identical to 90,000 year old spear points found in Africa, perhaps giving us an even earlier date for the beginnings of the Gondwana mythological scheme (or at least some cultural continuity forward from Pan-Gaea into Gondwana). Decorated spear points are a little like Turkish star temples, their rarity is not an indication of their uniqueness. Both require a culture in which to evolve.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>GENETICS</b></p>
<p class="indent">The length of time modern humans have existed in a temperate, largely predator-free environment that is now mostly lost beneath the ocean is highly significant in determining when and where Ice Age cultures may have developed complexity. Overlaying these two data instantly removes most of the more ambitious suggestions for the location of a so-called lost continent. But the insights afforded us by genetics do not stop with the peopling of the earth we saw in the last chapter. Far from it.</p>
<p class="indent">Returning to the metaphor of modern humans not being the only game in town, Sundaland was a veritable casino of different games. Out of anywhere on Earth, Island South East Asia is emerging as the place with the highest density and greatest variety of hominins. Most famously, we have <i>Homo floresiensis</i>, the &#x2018;Indonesian hobbit&#x2019; with whom we shared the landscape for at least thirty thousand years. Its origins are ultimately unknown, but it is currently suggested that it evolved from an even earlier colonial expedition from Africa and our shared ancestor may be more than two million years old. Perhaps every ex-Africa group turns right and keeps the ocean on their right until they run out of land?</p>
<p class="indent">A more recently discovered hominin, the Denisovan &#x2013; so named for the Siberian cave in which the first finger bone of the species, 50,000 years old, was discovered &#x2013;
<a id="page_68"></a>
was also a contemporaneous inhabitant of Sundaland with Homo sapiens. In fact, the highest levels of Denisovan genetic admixture have been found in blood samples in Island South East Asia and Oceania, demonstrating that we not only lived in the same vanished continental area, but also had sexual contact.</p>
<p class="indent">According to Mark Stoneking, professor at the Department of Evolutionary Genetics at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, &#x2018;the fact that Denisovan DNA can be detected in some but not other original inhabitant populations living in Southeast Asia today shows that numerous populations with and without Denisovan DNA existed over 44,000 years ago. The simplest explanation for the presence of Denisovan genetic material in some but not all groups is that Denisova people themselves lived in Southeast Asia.&#x2019;</p>
<p class="indent">Finding the 50,000 year old finger bone of an Oceanian hominin in a cave in Siberia is another one of those facts that leap out to tell us the story of our distant past was a lot more complex and a lot more global than it initially appeared.</p>
<p class="indent">A Taiwanese fisherman, 25 kilometres offshore, recently hauled up the jawbone, called Penghu 1, of what is probably another entirely new hominin species. It dates to between 130,000 and 190,000 years ago or 10,000 to 30,000 years ago. If those dates look strange, that&#x2019;s because they are. Being dredged from the ocean floor did not allow for it to be studied in stratigraphic context, all the collagen had leached out, which prevented radiocarbon dating, and U-series dating was unreliable due to a uranium overprint in the sea water. Nevertheless, that more recent date range puts Penghu 1 in the same location as modern humans at a time when we were there.</p>
<p class="indent">The potential for Sundaland and Sahul sexy times do not end here, either. Neanderthal admixture is often higher in East and Southeast Asian populations than with Europeans. It is also emerging that large amounts of genetic material responsible for our modern immune system &#x2013; perhaps up to 70% &#x2013; are the result of introgressions from these archaic near-human species, and that this transfer occurred after we left Africa. In a literal sense, it was &#x2018;laying with the daughters of Man&#x2019; that may have led to the survival of the little colonial project we call modern humanity.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>A BRIEF MYTHOLOGICAL INTERLUDE</b></p>
<p class="indent">I am aware that the suggestion that &#x2018;laying with the daughters of Man&#x2019; has some historical corollary is often highly dubious. It has a tendency to lead very quickly to claims that conehead aliens are our overlords and their descendants still run the world. This arises from a persistent confusion of mythology with history. But as Karen Armstrong points out in <i>A Short History of Myth</i>:</p>
<a id="page_69"></a>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">[I]n the pre-modern world, when people wrote about the past they were more concerned with what the event had meant. A myth was an event which, in some sense, happened once, but which also happened all the time. Because of our strictly chronological view of history, we have no word for such an occurrence, but mythology is an art form that points beyond history to what is timeless in human existence.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">Mythology allows for the retention of meaning within a culture, meaning that may have arisen as a result of historical events in the far distant past. It is our failure to recognise the conflation of timelines into contemporaneous religious expression.</p>
<p class="indent">The Nephilim are not Denisovans who lived in Sundaland. However, there was a scientifically observable sexual transfer of genetic material between males who weren&#x2019;t <i>Homo sapiens</i> and females who were in the distant past, which would have presumably been reflected in the mythology of the time. It may well be that this Palaeolithic mythology had some influence on the Eurasian stories that ultimately became the Babylonian and Hebrew Nephilim stories. These encounters may well be survivals of &#x2018;Gondwana history&#x2019; into &#x2018;Laurasian mythology.&#x2019; Interpreting any of these &#x2018;story layers&#x2019; literally or in isolation will lead you astray.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>A RETURN TO GENETICS</b></p>
<p class="indent">Because of the high frequency of their occurrence, mutations or adaptations forming as a response to disease or environmental conditions are frequently used to track ancient population movements. From the Spice Islands, which were mountains at the time, we have a 30,000 year old genetic adaptation to cold weather. A very similar adaptation is found in contemporaneous samples from northern Europe. As mentioned in the opening of this chapter, Sundaland had a temperate climate and was &#x2013; and is &#x2013; considerably warmer than northern Europe. The only environmental factor that might lead to this adaptation would be open ocean travel, where it can get very cold and wet at night. This adaptation is found in Polynesian samples right across the Pacific.</p>
<p class="indent">Perhaps the most famous population marker is the Polynesian Motif. It is actually three separate malarial adaptations, from oldest to youngest, and the story of its distribution is the story of Sundaland.</p>
<p class="num"><span class="num">1</span> The oldest of these 9 base-pair deletions, called by Dr Oppenheimer &#x2018;the Asian grandmother,&#x2019; is 60,000 years old and originates on the mainland. This aligns well with the current understanding of when Sundaland was originally inhabited and
<a id="page_70"></a>
from where. It also shows up in American samples but whether this is because the mutation happened before the populations separated and went north into America or whether it was spread at a later date through the Pacific is not known. It is probably both, as we have evidence from a study published in <i>PLOS Genetics</i> in April 2013 of trans-Pacific contact in Ainu blood samples dating back at least 6,000 years and possibly up to 10,000, based on cultural similarities between the Ainu and the J&#x014D;mon of Japan. If you are looking for the smoking gun for global sea travel right at the end of the Ice Age, then this may turn out to be it.</p>
<p class="num"><span class="num">2</span> Returning to the Polynesian Motif, the second substitution is called &#x2018;the Southeast Asian mother&#x2019; and is most likely to have originated, as you might expect, in Southeast Asia or Island Southeast Asia. It is the most widely distributed of the three markers, reaching right out into Oceania and Polynesia, as well as back into India and even up into Tibet. The birth of the Southeast Asian Mother from the Asian Grandmother happened 30,000 years ago.</p>
<p class="num"><span class="num">3</span> The final substitution, the &#x2018;true&#x2019; Polynesian Motif, originates in eastern Indonesia 17,000 years ago &#x2013; long before the end of the Ice Age &#x2013; and spreads eastward into Melanesia perhaps around 6,000 years ago and then out into the Pacific with successive waves of colonisers over the next five millennia. This &#x2018;first stage followed by many stages&#x2019; aligns precisely with the hypothetical migrations of the refugees of a dramatic sea level rise and their descendants.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">It is useful to consider the specific genetic links between this corner of the world and subsequent areas of examination. The map shows where else on the planet you can find genetic evidence tying back to the Austronesian-speaking domain of Island Southeast Asia. It is highly suggestive of a shared origin for some physical and non-physical technologies.</p>
<p class="indent">Most significantly, there is penetration of the Southeast Asian Mother into India, particularly in the north, as well as a sharp north/south divide that aligns well with current archaeological interpretations of pre-Vedic and Dravidic divides. (Although I expect a further blurring of this archaeological divide in coming years.) South India and Sri Lanka actually show more diversity in these 9 base-pair deletions from Southeast Asia, however they trace back to everywhere except the Malay Peninsula, where the Southeast Asian Mother originated. This diversity likely indicates sustained east-to-west contact at an earlier date. (Increasing diversity is associated with longer periods in which mutations can form and be passed down.) Returning to Dr Oppenheimer:</p>
<a id="page_71"></a>
<p class="image"><a id="ch04fig6"></a><img src="images/f0071-01.jpg" width="100%" alt="Images"/></p>
<p class="fig"><a href="05_Illustrations.xhtml#rch04fig6"><i><span class="fig">fig. 6</span> Specific genetic links between the Austronesian Homeland, Eurasia and the South Pacific</i></a></p>
<a id="page_72"></a>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">The final prediction of the southern Austro-Asiatic homeland hypothesis is that the migration of Austro-Asiatic speakers to India went through the Straits of Malacca shortly after the rising sea opened it over 8,000 years ago &#x2026; A recent analysis of Indian mtDNA types reveals not only multiple East Asian intrusions into the Indian subcontinent, but a clear north-south division as well. Another conclusion from this latter study is that the antiquity of East Asian mtDNA markers suggests a very ancient migration west.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">Asian mtDNA markers also show up very early in parts of Scandinavia, particularly in Finland. It is interesting to note that the Saami, whose <i>Kalevala</i> has Asian and Pacific echoes, may be genetically the closest to those first Asian arrivals. Layering in thalassemia data on top of mtDNA results, a picture of contact from Southeast Asia, to India and the Bay of Bengal, stretching up into the Middle East and Kurdistan also begins to form. Dr Oppenheimer concludes that genetic trees constructed for Asian populations all have Southeast Asia placed in their oldest branches. It is these same markers that were carried out into the Pacific, north along the Chinese coast and even across to the Middle East.</p>
<p class="indent">Searching for the counter-hypothesis to the Southeast Asian influence on Eurasian cultures and mythologies, the so-called &#x2018;pincer model&#x2019; suggests there was a second exodus out of Africa around 40,000 <small>BCE</small> that went eastward into Eurasia and the Levant. If this were so, such an expedition would have left a genetic fingerprint that would allow us to easily identify the resulting Central Asian group. There is no such evidence and so far no Central or North Asian lineages have been found that are not ultimately derived from Southeast Asian ones.</p>
<p class="indent">On the other side of the Pacific, more and more genetic data find themselves in alignment with the broad strokes of early human population movements as described in both the Laurasian model and the linguistic analysis described below. Brazilian geneticist S&#x00E9;rgio Pena has found mtDNA markers in the skulls of the indigenous Botocudo people that also show up in Polynesians and as far afield as Madagascar, which is largely the same footprint as the Austronesian language group.</p>
<p class="indent">So we have the geology of a sunken land, we have the genetic data indicating first arrival and contact with other archaic humans and we also have blood markers indicating the spread of these people toward the corners of the globe most associated with the emergence of V. Gordon Childe&#x2019;s concept of civilisation after the last great sea level rise at the end of the Ice Age. What is so crucial to understand &#x2013; and so often misunderstood &#x2013; is that these data show genetic contact with <i>existing local populations</i>, not the peopling of otherwise unoccupied lands from an origin in Southeast Asia.
<a id="page_73"></a>
Such a situation has mythological parallels in the flood stories of each of the areas with evidence of contact: the arrival of wisdom teachers from a sunken land across the sea. It is the contention of this book that some of these flood stories are tumbled down cultural memories of just such incidents.</p>
<p class="indent">In the last chapter we were introduced to Dr Witzel&#x2019;s Laurasian scheme, which he admits is currently lacking a homeland. Indologist to the last, it seems his refusal to consider Sahul or Sundaland as the first place to give rise to the Laurasian storyline is down to personal preference. In earlier versions of his thesis, Dr Witzel maintained that the rise of Laurasia was associated with the hypothetical &#x2018;second exodus&#x2019; out of Africa into Central Eurasia, where the Laurasian theme developed, before realising it has zero genetic evidence to support it. Rather than reconsider the growing evidence of cultural and genetic complexity in Sahul/Sundaland, he relies on yet another hypothesis: &#x2018;we will have to account for the spread of Laurasian mythologies into Southeast and East Asia with a different scenario &#x2013; for example, a purely hypothetical second wave of migration via India to Southeast Asia or a post-Ice Age reflux into Southeast Asia from what is now China by speakers of Tibeto-Burmese and Austric languages, whose ancestors had arrived there at <small>C</small>. 40 kya.&#x2019; Once again, we mention the obligation of proof.</p>
<p class="indent">Dr Witzel does, however, make the very good point that chickens and pigs, both native to Southeast Asia, are almost absent in other Laurasian mythologies. The expectation appears to be that this would not be the case if the Laurasian storyline emerged there. They may not be evident in mythologies, but they are certainly evident in spiritual taboos and dietary prohibitions. By his own scheme, the rise of the Laurasian novel long predates the domestication of the pig or chicken so I am not sure what kind of visibility he expects them to have in mythological motifs.</p>
<p class="indent">Ultimately, the question then becomes whether we have data indicating the rise of cultural complexity in Sundaland so very long ago. And the answer is yes.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>LINGUISTICS</b></p>
<p class="indent">Historically, the study of ancient languages suffered from its own challenges to do with both artificial and real horizons. Because the field of linguistics first arose within Indo-European languages, it began by tracing its own family tree backwards, noting loan words and comparisons, effectively building a family tree back to a presumed root language. (Which, incidentally, arose in eastern Cappadocia, not overly far from G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe, around the time the temple was still in use.)</p>
<p class="indent">Such analyses are fine, however they have a horizon of utility of about 7,000 years ago, beyond which most competent linguists will tell you there simply aren&#x2019;t enough
<a id="page_74"></a>
words available for meaningful comparison. Dr Johanna Nichols, linguist at UC Berkley, makes this observation in her <i>Linguistic Diversity in Space and Time</i>:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">[T]here has been a strong tendency to approach all historical problems as problems in the structure and description of family trees, as well as a tendency to assume that the great majority of languages in any continent naturally go back to a single ancestor just as the great majority of languages in western Eurasia do. In fact, however, a number of historical problems &#x2026; are better approached as population-typological or geographical issues. Such an approach has the advantage that it can take us farther back in time than the comparative method can and see graspable facts and patterns where the comparative-historical method has nothing at all to work with &#x2026; The fate of Indo-European, or more generally the fate of a group of typologically similar language families from post-Neolithic inner Asia, has not only distorted theory and method but skewed nature and reality as well.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">About 7,000 years ago is where our particular story ends rather than begins. To get beyond this, Dr Nichols pioneered a methodology that, in terms of its usefulness and implications, is on par with the discovery of archaeological stratigraphy.</p>
<p class="indent">Briefly, she classified much of the world&#x2019;s languages into yes/no categories based on their grammatical structure. Do they have a &#x2018;subject-object-verb&#x2019; word order, for instance. The resulting data lend themselves to a fascinating statistical analysis of linguistic diversity.</p>
<p class="indent">To take just one example of the effects that can be observed, reductions in linguistic diversity are often associated with rises in cultural complexity. On the surface, this may appear counterintuitive but we know it from the historical period. The rise of empires led to the spread of Latin or Arabic or English or Spanish across previously diverse and discrete linguistic territories. This shows up as a reduction in grammatical complexity as indigenous languages are either obliterated or hybridised in order to facilitate economic and political communication across much larger land areas.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">[T]his survey has uncovered no evidence that human language in general has changed since the earliest stages recoverable by the methods used here. There is simply diversity, distributed geographically. The only thing that has demonstrably changed since the first stage of humanity is the geographical distribution of diversity.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<a id="page_75"></a>
<p class="indent">Collections of grammatical structures &#x2013; either increasing or decreasing in complexity &#x2013; can then be observed moving through the tongues of the world. What Dr Nichols discovered were three great stages in the peopling of the world.</p>
<p class="indent">The first stage began in Africa more than a hundred thousand years ago and was a time of great linguistic diversity. &#x2018;Societies would have been small, simple and autonomous, and the environment was of course tropical, conditions that foster diversity today.&#x2019;</p>
<p class="indent">The second is called the stage of expansion, from about 60,000 years ago to 30,000 years ago. It is characterised by population movements that would have required knowledge of seafaring and adaptation to sometimes extreme climates. &#x2018;This stage too must have involved increasing diversity for that part of the linguistic population that participated in the expansion, but it may ultimately have led to the extinction of many lineages that did not, for the genetic density in Africa and tropical Eurasia is now very low.&#x2019; The second stage aligns pleasingly with the location and timing of the Southeast Asian Mother&#x2019;s appearance in Sundaland.</p>
<p class="indent">The third and final stage provides the most significant linguistic evidence for the cultural impact of cataclysmic survivors on the development of culture elsewhere in the world. Beginning at the end of glaciation, Dr Nichols shows that it is &#x2018;circum-Pacific colonisation that has populated most of the world, given rise to most of the genetic lineages of human languages and colonised the New World.&#x2019; The trip to the Americas was up from Sundaland rather than across from Siberia, following the sea level rise that accompanied the end of the Ice Age.</p>
<p class="indent">Narrowing back down to the dominant language family of the area, Austronesian, we find that it actually stretches all the way from Madagascar, along the coast, through Island Southeast Asia and out into the vast Pacific. It is unrelated to any mainland Asian language families and its homeland has not been definitively identified, although Wilhelm Solheim believes it is probably in eastern Indonesia. He calls the maritime culture that developed it the Nusantao. As Dr Oppenheimer notes, &#x2018;even non-linguists might think it surprising there is not a single mainland tongue to give firm Asian provenance for the Austronesian family. Asia is after all the nearest continent.&#x2019;</p>
<p class="indent">Despite the complete lack of evidence, the spread of Austronesian into the region was historically tied to the spread of rice cultivation into South East Asia. There may well be something to this theory, however recent archaeological evidence suggests the spread went in the opposite direction, from the islands to the mainland.</p>
<a id="page_76"></a>
<p class="h3"><b>AGRICULTURE</b></p>
<p class="indent">There is a very ethnocentric perceptual bias in how we conceive of farming. We tend to picture the classic amber waves of grain. This ignores the fact that for most of agriculture&#x2019;s history, most of the world&#x2019;s population actually ate rice.</p>
<p class="indent">The bias does not stop there. We also have a tendency to picture farming as the replacement of indigenous plant life with one or two imports that are tended and harvested on an annual basis. But if we widen our definition to include cultivation of local species &#x2013; to giving Nature a helping hand in doing what she was already doing &#x2013; then the story becomes quite different, and significantly older.</p>
<p class="indent">Yams, for instance, are absurdly easy to cultivate. You put a few of them in the ground and ignore them. When you come back, you have a lot more. Wild yam and taro cultivation was happening in Indonesia around 15,000 years ago. By about 7,000 <small>BCE</small> we begin to see evidence of barley cultivation in the Indus Valley. At this time, in the mountains of New Guinea, locals had been draining swamps for wild plant cultivation for millennia.</p>
<p class="indent">Further north, the J&#x014D;mon of Japan had developed pottery for fish storage by 13,000 <small>BCE</small>, indicating that the so-called &#x2018;Pre Pottery Neolithic&#x2019; we see at G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe is not a universal term. It is the Jomon, incidentally, who have the strongest genetic links with the Americas. Stones for grinding wild cereals appear in the Solomon Islands 26,000 years ago, more than ten millennia earlier than in the Fertile Crescent. Returning to the growing evidence for rice cultivation before the flood, remains have been found in two caves on the Malay Peninsula; the Spirit Cave and the Sakai Cave, possibly going as far back as 10,000 <small>BCE</small>. This is significantly in advance of rice cultivation on the Asian mainland. Rice is a remarkable plant. From Sri Owen&#x2019;s <i>Rice Book</i>:</p>

<p class="quote">Upland rices grow in forest clearings or unterraced hillsides, asking only for generous rainfall. Swamp or deepwater rices are happy in flood conditions near river mouths, able to grow 10&#x2013;15 centimetres a day to keep pace with the rising water level &#x2026; Traditional rice varieties reach maturity in anything from 140&#x2013;240 days; some modern ones mature in 90 days, allowing a quick-moving farmer to grow two, three, or even four crops in a year.</p>
<p class="quotei">That is another astonishing characteristic of irrigated rice. You can grow it in the same field, year after year, indefinitely &#x2013; some rice fields are believed to have been continuously cropped for two thousand years or more.</p>

<p class="indent">If you are looking for the starch that would be the easiest to gradually cultivate over centuries of observation, and the one that would net the largest reward in doing so,
<a id="page_77"></a>
then it is probably rice. We will never know if Sundaland&#x2019;s river mouths held cultivated rice fields but they were almost certainly home to the uncultivated grain.</p>
<p class="indent">It is interesting to note that the earliest evidence of rice growing in Northern India aligns with the timelines for genetic contact with Island Southeast Asia. It is similarly interesting to note that the latest evidence from the Zagros Mountains of Iran has led archaeologists to conclude that &#x2018;there was no single origin for agriculture&#x2019; in the Fertile Crescent as they have not found one. This interpretation, as Dr Oppenheimer points out earlier in this chapter, has an obligation of proof.</p>
<p class="indent">Tracing the genetic origins of domesticated foods offers the alternate palaeological researcher a plethora of smoking guns. You are unlikely to find less scrupulous divisions between fact and interpretation. The sweet potato has been proven to have arrived in the western Pacific (Sundaland) from the Americas &#x2018;some time in prehistory&#x2019; and then is ignored. The melon, an important foodstuff in China and Iran around 5,000 <small>BCE</small>, must have been domesticated in Africa (or Australia) before that. The cucumber originated in the Himalayas but was grown in huge quantities in Ancient Egypt. Chickens, also Southeast Asian, appear in Egypt by 2,000 <small>BCE</small>. Recent mitochondrial research into the earliest domestication of chickens demonstrates that this Southeast Asian bird, fully domesticated, was found in Northern China by 10,500 <small>BCE</small>.</p>
<p class="indent">The dog appears to have been domesticated from a local wolf population somewhere south of the Yangtze 16,500 years ago, with the genetic diversity getting higher the further into Southeast Asia the samples came from.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x2018;Lemon&#x2019; and &#x2018;cinnamon,&#x2019; both Austronesian words referring to Southeast Asian plants, appear at the very beginning of the Indus culture. The Hindu words for cloves and camphor are also Austronesian imports, thus completing, in Dr Oppenheimer&#x2019;s words, &#x2018;a chain of Austronesian language contact stretching from Japan around the coast of Asia to the birthplace of Western civilisation.&#x2019;</p>
<p class="indent">Further evidence of the high level of cultural complexity in what is now Island Southeast Asia can be found by looking in the opposite direction to the general Northwest path our story will follow. As we have seen, there is a high degree of overlap between Siberian shamanic and North American indigenous beliefs. This is to be expected given the evidence for migration around the 10,000&#x2013;15,000 <small>BCE</small> mark, at which point these cultures were solidly Laurasian. However, there is significantly less overlap between the indigenous beliefs of South America and North America, with Southern cultures showing a much higher overlap with Melanesian and Australian beliefs. Given the much earlier date of arrival into South America &#x2013; between 30,000 and 20,000 <small>BCE</small> at the latest &#x2013; an opportunity to countercheck the cosmology of Sundaland presents itself. This will be explored in the next chapter.</p>

<p class="h3"><b>A QUESTION OF STRUCTURES</b></p>
<p class="indent">Given that we have to replace harbour breakwaters every century or so due to the natural erosion of wave action, the expectation of finding the type of Palaeolithic remains that would satisfy a Hollywood set designer is, politely, ambitious. This would be the case even if the end of the Ice Age had been a gradual process, but it is becoming clear that, at least once in our history, human eyes witnessed mile-high superwaves hurtling back across the exposed ocean bed toward them. You only need to watch a few videos of the Japanese tsunami to see what can happen to even technologically advanced cultures following what was a tame sea incursion by historical standards.</p>
<p class="indent">However, it is possible there are indeed remains of physical, potentially megalithic structures on Sundaland. Close to the Indonesian capital of Jakarta is a site known as Gunung Padang, usually translated as &#x2018;Mount Meadow/Field&#x2019; which does not make much sense. A secondary translation of &#x2018;Mount of Light&#x2019; or &#x2018;Mountain of Enlightenment&#x2019; seems more likely.</p>
<p class="indent">Gunung Padang is a large hill composed of overlapping, columnar basalt &#x2018;logs&#x2019; that form a rough step pyramid shape. Tens of millions of years ago, as the andesite lava cooled and contracted, cracks propagated throughout the rock. This process resulted in the creation of surprisingly geometric hexagonal &#x2018;logs,&#x2019; clumped together like a fistful of pencils. These columns form vertically but are comparatively easy to dislodge and use for building material, even with the means available twenty thousand years ago.</p>
<p class="indent">Many of the columns are arranged horizontally into walls and also roofs of interior chambers that have been detected inside the structure. It is currently composed of five terraces with a base that covers an area of 150 metres by 40 metres. These terraces are outlined with what appear to be both building foundations and pavements.</p>
<p class="indent">Gunung Padang is aligned just off North, but directly faces another &#x2018;holy mountain&#x2019; in the same area, indicating that it may be part of a much large ritual complex. The hills surrounding Gunung Padang are currently used for growing tea but have a very long history of gold mining. Indeed, the area has long-lived mythological associations with gold. Old mines and tunnels are commonly found under the plantations. In light of the discovery of Gunung Padang&#x2019;s advanced age, it is worth considering whether some of these tunnels require redating.</p>
<p class="indent">Its summit today is about 3000 feet above sea level. During the Ice Age this would have been much higher as the sea level was much lower. In fact, from the top of Gunung Padang, you would have had a commanding view north across the plains and hills of Sundaland.</p>

<a id="page_80"></a>
<p class="indent">According to Dr Robert Schoch&#x2019;s analysis of the geological evidence, which encompasses ground penetrating radar, electrical resistivity, seismic readings and bore hole drilling, the earliest use of the site definitely dates to 14,700 <small>BCE</small> and potentially up to 22,000 <small>BCE</small> and beyond. At either end of this date range, we are still firmly in the Pleistocene and getting on towards Dr Witzel&#x2019;s 30,000 <small>BCE</small> date for the development of Laurasian mythology which, you will recall, counts the Mound of Creation among its mythemes.</p>
<p class="indent">Staying with that idea, Dr Schoch has identified human-shaped, internal lava tubes within the mound. The entrance to one of them, at Layer 3, dates to around 10,000 <small>BCE</small> which is right at the beginning of the end of the Ice Age. A major chamber with a length of around 15 metres is located about 30 metres under the summit. Given the subsequent genetic, mythological and linguistic connections to other pyramid or ziggurat-building cultures around the world, it is extremely tempting to consider the possibility that they could have represented not only the Mound of Creation, but potentially a human-altered volcano &#x2013; even this specific volcano &#x2013; with all the subsequent chthonic meanings that would imply.</p>
<p class="indent">Much has been made locally of the recent findings by Dr Danny Hilman Natawidjaja that his noninvasive geophysical studies have yielded a date of over 20,000 years old. It is no reflection of Dr Natawidjaja&#x2019;s scientific credentials &#x2013; he received his PhD from Caltech &#x2013; to suggest caution in interpreting the significance of these results. His was a government study and the idea that &#x2018;Indonesia is Atlantis&#x2019; falls squarely into the politics of science discussed in an earlier chapter. In confidential discussions had during the research for this book, I have been made aware of the fact that there are a number of &#x2018;true believers,&#x2019; so to speak, holding high office in the Indonesian government.</p>
<p class="indent">None of this invalidates Dr Natawidjaja&#x2019;s data but it certainly speaks of the need for additional caution before conclusions can be drawn. We already know Island South East Asia was a site of Ice Age cultural complexity. Sulawesi is home to some of the earliest cave art belonging to the Palaeolithic Renaissance, with an age of 40,000 years ago. This date will likely be revised down, given it was drawn from the mineral accretions on top of a painted handprint. In this exact corner of the world we have:</p>

<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> And now we have a very large, artificial structure that is highly resonant with the beliefs and architecture of these later cultures.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">If this is not the actual homeland of Laurasia, and thus much of the western magical tradition, then the culture or cultures of Sundaland certainly had a profound impact on wherever that place may turn out to be. It is certainly an extreme case of non-random distribution.</p>
<p class="indent">Where might we look to find evidence to validate this hypothesis?</p>
