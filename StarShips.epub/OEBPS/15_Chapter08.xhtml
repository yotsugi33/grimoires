<p class="indent" style="margin-top:2em;">When it came to the stars, the Egyptians were not fucking around. In order to explore this crucial pivot point in the development of western astrotheology, I have to assume the reader has a reasonable knowledge of Ancient Egypt history and topography, because there simply is not the space for hand-holding. In terms of the latter, a quick image search on your phone will suffice to locate any cities or sites you may be unfamiliar with. In terms of the former, there are any number of worthwhile books to choose from.</p>
<p class="indent">I mention this because there is a persistent tendency among occultists to treat the entire length of Ancient Egyptian civilisation as broadly the same. But the Isis of the Late Period is not the Isis of the Old Kingdom. An analogy with Jesus, who has been a god for a lot less time than the Mother of Horus, is illustrative. Early depictions of Jesus show him as a peacock or a fish, then a glowing, Apollonian child, then the actual sun. Sometimes he has a beard and sometimes he doesn&#x2019;t. In the east he shows
<a id="page_156"></a>
up in icons with the sort of creepy stare you associate with escaped mental patients riding on the same bus as you. He&#x2019;s black in a few places but not all that many. During the Renaissance he becomes a pin-up for some profoundly homoerotic, hyperreal sadomasochism. By the time we get to the megachurches of regional America he is an unadorned stick in an enormous room, standing behind a man who is loudly asking a bank of television cameras for more money. He has had a busy 1,800 years, especially for someone who never physically existed.</p>
<p class="indent">We see a similar thing in Egypt over a much longer time frame, with gradual changes to cosmology matching the changes in society and the shifting of centres of power up and down the Nile as priesthoods rise and fall, before finally reaching a dizzying hybridity in the Late and Graeco-Roman Period as the Egyptians adopted the same &#x2018;Lego block&#x2019; approach to divinities as the Greeks. That final hybrid phase is the fertile swamp from which a largely recognisable modern western magic grows.</p>
<p class="indent">Endlessly fascinating as the full sweep of Ancient Egyptian history is, our principal focus is on the parts leading up to the First Intermediate Period in the following table.</p>

<p class="indent">The official narrative goes something like this. The Predynastic Period was a time of scattered villages up and down the Nile, building things out of mud bricks. The Dynastic Period begins in earnest with a king from Upper Egypt unifying the country by force. Thereupon he and his descendants start building pointy tombs of increasing complexity, then decreasing complexity but this time with writing inside them, and then Egypt is invaded and collapses (the First Intermediate Period). Things get slightly better again, access to the afterlife is democratised and commoners start painting gods and judgement on the inside of their coffins, some new priests are in charge and
<a id="page_157"></a>
then the whole place collapses through invasion again. The New Kingdom is where all the telegenic stuff you see in documentaries happens: Ramses, Tutankhamun, that pointy headed one with the lady hips on the History Channel who worships UFOs or something. Then there&#x2019;s another collapse from which the country never really recovers. It proceeds through a succession of largely foreign rulers until Alexander the Great invades the place, installs the Ptolemies on the throne and that period ends with Cleopatra committing suicide with a snake to the boob.</p>
<p class="indent">But if you look back up at the first row in the table, you will see that &#x2018;before 3,100 <small>BCE</small>&#x2019; has so far been where all the action in the book has been. To get a clearer picture, we must erase some of these artificial horizons and look at the whole spectrum.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>THE (GRAND) ROGUES&#x2019; GALLERY</b></p>
<p class="indent">Though we went to some trouble to shine a light on the highly dysfunctional culture of academia in a previous chapter, Egyptology certainly deserves to be singled out before we go any further, as it has been filled with thieves, vandals, hate-mongers and lunatics for centuries.</p>
<p class="indent">Nowhere is the need for reorienting of our understanding of the past around hard data more critical. Doing so tends to make &#x2018;expert consensus&#x2019; opinion melt away like cake in the rain, which may explain why they are so loudly hostile to its introduction into the discourse. Egyptological gate-keeping is probably the most shrill among all the humanities subjects masquerading as hard sciences.</p>
<p class="indent">Speaking of gatekeeping, a story told by an independent researcher is metaphorically and literally illustrative. During research trips for his two latest books, <i>Egyptian Dawn</i> and <i>The Sphinx Mystery</i>, Robert Temple had to get authorities to smash rusted locks with hammers because the keys had been lost decades ago, granting access to parts of the Valley Temple and Sphinx Temple, where he found entirely undocumented chambers and described them for the first time. These are sites that, even with the calamitous drop-off in tourist numbers in recent times, millions of people walk past each year and can often peer into, as they are open to the air. Some of the temple areas he &#x2018;discovered&#x2019; actually had cables running through them that were laid down by staging technicians for the evening light show! That is how poorly the official narrative actually matches the facts on the ground. It was not a lack of funds that prevented bringing these &#x2018;discoveries&#x2019; to the public &#x2013; borrowing a hammer to break a lock is free &#x2013; anymore than a lack of funds would prevent the discovery of a second Magic Mountain at Disneyland. It was systemic ineptitude and cronyism on the part of Egyptology. Given Giza&#x2019;s importance to Egyptian history &#x2013; and probably the esoteric history of much of mankind &#x2013; this is outrageous.</p>
<a id="page_158"></a>
<p class="indent">Outrage, inevitably, is a common emotion among Egyptology watchers. You will no doubt be familiar with Zahi Hawass and his ubiquitous hat from the last two decades of largely content-free cable history programmes. (And the subsequent Department of Justice investigation into <i>National Geographic</i> and Zahi Hawass for allegations of bribery. By their own admission, they are paying him $200,000 a year for life. His government salary was approximately &#x00A3;10,000.) From humble beginnings in the Egyptian Delta, Hawass was plucked from his minor Giza inspector role by the direct intervention of the son of Edgar Cayce, Hugh Lynn; who arranged a full scholarship at the University of Pennsylvania thanks to a member of the scholarship board also happening to be a member of Cayce&#x2019;s Association for Research and Enlightenment. (This was part of the ARE&#x2019;s multi-decade attempts to get special access to sites on the Giza Plateau, specifically the structures underneath the Sphinx where Cayce believed the Atlantean hall of records was to be found.)</p>
<p class="indent">Hawass&#x2019;s curious associations do not end there. In <i>Breaking the Mirror of Heaven</i>, Robert Bauval and Ahmed Osman recount the tale of a &#x2018;surprise&#x2019; visit to the Giza Plateau by none other than NATO-deposed Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Hawass had set up a small table between the paws of the Sphinx to display some recently discovered statues dating back to the Fifth Dynasty. One in particular was exceedingly rare as it still retained some of its original paintwork. The then-head of the Egyptian Antiquities Organisation, the job Hawass was gunning for and got, heard about the visit on the radio as he had not been informed. He raced over there in a taxi only to find Hawass declaring that one of the statues was &#x2018;missing.&#x2019; This was the very same statue Hawass used in a magazine photoshoot with Omar Sharif only three months prior.</p>
<p class="indent">The man solely responsible for worldwide archaeological access within Egypt certain kept some unusual company but we can be sure of one thing. Very few of them were Jews, as Hawass is fiercely antisemitic. He has repeatedly declared that anyone who disagrees with him is part of a Zionist conspiracy, held press conferences in which he announces the Jews did not build the pyramids and that Israel is trying to steal the pyramids and Egyptian civilisation. Antisemitism inevitably plays well to the crowd in Arab countries, but Hawass takes even this to exciting, conspiracy-laden levels. In a 2009 interview on Egypt&#x2019;s Memri TV, he said that Jews control the entire world: &#x2018;For 18 centuries, they were dispersed throughout the world. They went to America and took control of its economy. They have a plan. Although they are few in number, they control the entire world.&#x2019;</p>
<p class="indent">How did the global archaeological community deal with Hawass&#x2019;s terrifying reign? Uneasily, and with stony, cowardly silence. From a 2005 <i>New York Times</i> article by Sharon Waxman:</p>
<a id="page_159"></a>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">But there are those who say Dr. Hawass does not merely impose rules, he hogs the field. Last year two French researchers accused Dr. Hawass of treating Egypt as &#x2018;his private hunting ground&#x2019; after they were denied permission to insert a camera lens through the floor of the Great Pyramid at Giza in search of a secret chamber. Dr. Hawass denounced the men as amateurs, though they have successfully made other discoveries with the technique.</p>
<p class="quotei">Dr. Hawass also denounced as &#x2018;nuts&#x2019; an English archaeologist, Joann Fletcher, who announced a theory in 2003 that a previously discovered mummy was in fact Queen Nefertiti. British press accounts say that Dr. Hawass was more upset that she had revealed her findings on the Discovery Channel, which financed her work, rather than bringing the results to him to announce. She was banned from further work in Egypt.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">Egyptology in action, right there. Where is the global outrage from the likes of the British Museum or the Smithsonian? In the May 22 2005 issue of the <i>Sunday Times Magazine</i>, Richard Girling wrote:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">&#x2018;They call him the Pharaoh, the keeper of the pyramids. He rules Egyptology with an iron fist and a censorious tongue. Nobody crosses Zahi Hawass and gets away with it &#x2026; nobody of any standing in Egyptology will come out to help you,&#x2019; said one well-known Egyptologist of his colleagues, &#x2018;because they&#x2019;d lose their jobs.&#x2019; &#x2026; Hawass &#x2026; holds the keys to the pyramids, the Valley of the Kings, the Sphinx, Abu Simbel, everything. No Egyptologist gets in without his permission, and few will chance his anger. [&#x2026;]</p>
<p class="quotei">&#x2018;There are people digging out there,&#x2019; says another UK specialist, &#x2018;who are praying they won&#x2019;t find anything significant. If they do, they know the dig will be shut down until a certain individual arrives to take over. There are artefacts that have been excavated, only to be put back until the certain personage gets round to visiting the site so that he can &#x201C;discover&#x201D; them for himself.&#x2019;</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">Another Cayce angle comes by way of Mark Lehner, described as the world&#x2019;s foremost authority on the Sphinx and the Pyramids. The son of ARE members, it was Hugh Lynn, once again, who arranged the funding for Lehner to study at the American University in Cairo. (In fact it was Lehner who made the introduction between Hawass and Hugh Lynn.) To give credit where it is due, the Association for Research and Enlightenment has played a very successful long game. In his previously mentioned book and <i>The Secret Chamber</i>, Bauval notes that he has video and photographic
<a id="page_160"></a>
proof of ARE excavations and photometric research in and around the Sphinx and the Pyramid enclosures.</p>
<p class="indent">But this is, in fact, the heart of the matter. The Hawass regime was a time of &#x2018;multiple Egyptologies,&#x2019; with tightly controlled paid access made available to various private organisations combined with a simultaneous doubling-down on an &#x2018;official narrative&#x2019; that, as we shall see, is positively Discworldian in its absurdity. If you did not stump up the money or toe the line, you were branded a pyramidiot and a Jew. Even as this chapter was being written, Zahi Hawass stormed out of a planned debate with Graham Hancock when he saw an image of Robert Bauval on one of the slides, declared him &#x2018;a thief,&#x2019; claimed he had never heard of G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe, and then would only deign to return to the room if the debate was cancelled. <i>National Geographic</i> has certainly had better behaved, better informed (if not better paid) &#x2018;Explorers in Residence.&#x2019;</p>
<p class="indent">Very occasionally, this clown show has resulted in exasperation in the wider, more scientifically inclined corners of Egyptology, such as in the following from the <i>Proceedings of the Ninth International Congress of Egyptologists</i> in 2004, by the delightfully passionate Alfredo Gennaro.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">Nevertheless we think it is worthy to give credit to some of the figures we had to face in the preliminary study [on hypothetical construction methods and size of workforce]. At the light of these figures, the current hypotheses on how the Giza Pyramids were built appear to be inconsistent, sometimes completely impracticable. [&#x2026;]</p>
<p class="quotei">Figures! We need figures, not the generalities we can read in the &#x2018;accepted&#x2019; literature.</p>
<p class="quotei">Take the ramp theory. A ramp one km long to get the top of the Cheops Pyramid would have a slope not comfortable but possible, with a volume of 5,600,000 cubic meters, the double than the pyramid itself (sic): with the difference that the volume, divided in personal loads of 25 litres (50 kg at a time) would require 224,000,000 travels to be accumulated and as many to be dismantled, namely 90 years of a continuous one thousand person process.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">The ramp theory Gennaro refers to is one of the &#x2018;explanations&#x2019; offered by people with evidently no experience in construction for how the Great Pyramid in particular was ever managed to be built as a tomb in two and half decades during the reign of a single king. The &#x2018;generalities&#x2019; he mentions are the Egyptological tendency to breeze past this physical impossibility with a casual backwards comment: &#x2018;they probably used a ramp and I am sure we will find evidence of it one day.&#x2019;</p>
<a id="page_161"></a>
<p class="indent">Let me be clear. On available evidence, it is currently <i>more</i> likely that the pyramids were built by little green men in flying saucers than by a few thousand men, living in workers&#x2019; villages we have never been able to find, using a ramp with twice the volume of the structure it was used to build. Nevertheless, the ramp not only refuses to die, but resurfaces in the latest theory by the world&#x2019;s foremost authority on the Sphinx and the pyramids, Mark Lehner, who combines two nonexistent objects into one in a bewildering &#x2018;super solve.&#x2019; From a January 28, 2014 <i>Live Science</i> article by Owen Jarus:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">The recent discoveries [that the &#x2018;workers&#x2019; villages&#x2019; were actually barracks for highborn visitors] at Giza leave a mystery in their wake: Where were the dwellings of the pyramid builders, the regular workers, located?</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">The answer may be on the pyramids themselves. &#x2018;We could probably be correct imagining workers staying on the immense ramps, on the unfinished pyramid as it rose,&#x2019; said Lehner in an email to <i>Live Science</i>, adding that they could also have been living in the quarries in simple dwellings akin to &#x2018;lean-to&#x2019;s.&#x2019;</p>
<p class="indent">Even my truck-and-train obsessed nephew would find logistically dubious the idea of a workforce of up to a hundred thousand living on the construction site they were conscripted to for a period of two decades, having their sleeping quarters in the way of a ramp that would need to place a multi-tonne block in situ every ninety seconds. He is four years old. But we have very little need of my nephew&#x2019;s expertise because the independent Egyptological world &#x2013; Hawass&#x2019;s Jews and pyramidiots &#x2013; is, in fact, awash with specialist experts in topics that actually describe reality. These include engineers, nuclear physicists, geologists, desert construction experts &#x2013; fields where, if they get their numbers wrong, buildings collapse and planes fall out of the sky. And the good news is they appear to be winning the mind war. Not that Lehner&#x2019;s Rampopolis is not a particularly threatening opponent, of course. One may as well say the pyramid workers lived in Narnia and journeyed back through the wardrobe at the end of each day. (We will return to the ramp below, with a potential solve provided, inevitably, by an architect and a chemist rather than an Egyptologist.)</p>
<p class="indent">All of this is to emphasise that, when it comes to the story of Egypt&#x2019;s beginnings, the &#x2018;home team&#x2019; does not have a lot going for it, at least not in the past thirty or so years. The Egyptologists of a century ago displayed much greater willingness to follow where the evidence led them and would likely have relished the input of engineers, physicists and geologists, rather than dismissing their facts as irrelevant because &#x2018;they are not Egyptologists.&#x2019; This is akin to declaring crime does not exist because one does not happen to be a court sketch artist.</p>
<a id="page_162"></a>
<p class="indent">As ever, we will highlight the physical data and offer an interpretation that covers it rather than ignores it, as well as one that falls into broad alignment with the wider genetic, morphological, mythological and climatic data we have already examined. For magicians it is well remembered that, when it comes to data interpretation, out of anywhere on earth, here we are not playing in the Egyptologists&#x2019; sandpit. They are playing in ours.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>PREDYNASTIC EGYPT</b></p>
<p class="indent">Another artificial horizon is in need of erasure. The Pharaohs themselves did not think in dynasties. It was the third century <small>BCE</small> priest, Manetho, writing in Greek, who first categorised Egypt&#x2019;s ancient kings in this way. The idea is actually quite alien to Egyptian royalty, who focused on continuity, eternal cycles and Maat. In an important sense they each became the preceding ruler, meaning they would make terrible guests on <i>Who Do You Think You Are</i>. (Although the episodes themselves would be mercifully brief.)</p>
<p class="indent">Once freed of the dynastic concept, it becomes much easier to get a sense of quite how far back the Pharaohs thought their civilisation went. The unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under Menes &#x2013; where Manetho begins his dynasties &#x2013; was by no means the beginning of the story, just as the unification of Italy in the nineteenth century is not the beginning of Italian history. In fact, unsurprisingly given their common Laurasian origin, Egyptian kings &#x2013; just as their Sumerian counterparts did &#x2013; trace back beyond human kings to an era of semidivine rulers, to a time when Egypt was ruled by the gods themselves. The astronomical numbers used to describe their reigns indicate they saw these beings as the stars, too. In Seti I&#x2019;s Abydos temple &#x2013; a temple to the ancestors as described below &#x2013; he is depicted with his young son, Ramses II, petitioning Ptah-Seker-Osiris on behalf of their &#x2019;72 ancestors.&#x2019; Seventy two is the precessional number <i>par excellence</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">Manetho&#x2019;s dynasty-based king list is about as incomplete as the rest of them and, like our other sources for Egypt&#x2019;s rulers, they get messier the further back you go. From Robert Temple&#x2019;s <i>Egyptian Dawn</i>:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">The chronology of ancient Egyptian history is &#x2026; firmly established as far back as 2,000 <small>BCE</small>. Prior to that, there was something called the First Intermediate Period, which was a period of total social and political collapse. It is thought this period was marked by floods, droughts, plagues and lawlessness. No one knows exactly how long this period lasted, but &#x2026; many think it was about 150 years. [&#x2026;] Before this, there were the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties of the Old Kingdom. They
<a id="page_163"></a>
were a kind of tepid afterflow of the glory of the true Old Kingdom, which consisted of the Third and Fourth Dynasties. It used to be thought that the First and Second Dynasties should be considered part of the Old Kingdom, but now it has become fashionable to speak of those as the &#x2018;Archaic Period.&#x2019; One reason for that is we know so little about them. (However, it must be said that we know even less about the Third Dynasty, but people often overlook that fact.)</p>
<p class="quotei">The unsettling thing is that prior to &#x2013; let us say &#x2013; 2200 <small>BCE</small>, the chronology of Egyptian history essentially falls apart. Everything before that date is more or less lost in a kind of chronological chaos. There are many Egyptologists who do not think this. But that is because they simply comfort themselves with chronological assertions. They simply decide certain dates.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">The net effect of this is that no one has any idea how many kings there were in the Fourth Dynasty, the alleged period of Giza pyramid construction, or even how long it lasted. Only three royal funerary monuments from the Third Dynasty have been found. None of the historical sources agree on the number of kings or their names, but they all mention kings in between Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure; so where are their &#x2018;pointy tombs&#x2019;? Second Dynasty kings such as Teti share the same name with Sixth Dynasty kings &#x2013; they all had multiple names to start with &#x2013; and several sources used to compile the royal lineage of Egypt list names going back tens of millennia. (A Second Dynasty king&#x2019;s name was excavated in a Giza Valley Temple, purported to have been built in the Fourth Dynasty.)</p>
<p class="h4"><b>&#x2018;Unification&#x2019;</b></p>
<p class="indent">Emphasising the messiness of Egyptian chronology at the beginning of the so-called Dynastic Period is not another jab at the Ankh-Morpork college of global Egyptology &#x2013; I have already scratched that itch. It is simply to lengthen out the timelines that we need to work to. As with Sumerologists and Assyriologists insisting that everything be sandwiched into their arbitrary dates, the Egyptological refusal to kick out their timings has given rise to engineering impossibilities like building the Great Pyramid in a couple of decades using logs and dolerite pounders. And this refusal has attracted flying saucers just as surely as garbage attracts flies. It is amazing how much a little humility regarding what we do and do not currently understand about Predynastic Egypt can do to pack the saucers back off to Zeta Reticuli.</p>
<p class="indent">As the evidence of missing kings and overlapping dynasties is reexamined, it becomes clear that the story of the Nile valley and delta is anything but neat. Clearly cultures of differing levels of complexity existed simultaneously and side-by-side;
<a id="page_164"></a>
this is the cleanest, indeed the <i>only</i>, solve for having simultaneous reigns for Archaic and Predynastic kings. The Nile is a very long river, after all. It is largely our modern belief in national borders that prevents us from thinking about the place as a home to multiple kings and warlords.</p>
<p class="indent">There is a growing academic consensus that Menes, the king who unified Upper and Lower Egypt, is probably part of the same mythological &#x2018;law-giver&#x2019; type we find in other Laurasian cultures. Other examples would be &#x2018;Manu&#x2019; or &#x2018;Moses.&#x2019; If he did have an historical existence, then it appears his claim to have unified the country is the 3,100 <small>BCE</small> equivalent of descending from a helicopter onto the deck of an aircraft carrier and unfurling a &#x2018;mission accomplished&#x2019; banner. We may have been too credulous in expecting the politicians of the ancient world to be any different from our own. Otherwise, why do so many kings after Menes exclaim how they have also unified Egypt? One suspects the peasants have been revolting for a very long time.</p>
<p class="h4"><b>The African Fertile Crescent</b></p>
<p class="indent">Along the coast of North Africa, between the Egyptian Delta and the Atlantic, there are hundreds and hundreds of megalithic sites, some bearing a startling resemblance to Stonehenge, thanks to the presence of trilithons weighing in at dozens of tonnes. Most often, these are explained away as Roman olive presses, but the explanation does not hold up to very much scrutiny. Certainly, some of the sites may have been <i>repurposed</i> as such by the Romans, but we are left with the fact that First Dynasty jars that once contained olive oil are marked as being from Libya or &#x2018;Olive Land&#x2019;/<i>Ta Tehenu</i>. Ancient Egyptian conceptions of Libya, or any other foreign land, were far from precise. It is generally accepted that &#x2018;Libya/Olive Land,&#x2019; since predynastic times, referred to the western delta of Egypt proper, all of coastal North Africa and potentially even parts of Southern Spain.</p>
<p class="indent">The scale of the agrarian society appears to have been substantial, based on the boasts of livestock volumes having been &#x2018;captured&#x2019; from &#x2018;Libya&#x2019; by kings right up to the Fourth Dynasty numbering in the hundreds of thousands, potentially millions. For those very early kings of Upper Egypt, the tattooed Libyans of the western delta and their vast herds would have looked very appealing.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the questions Robert Temple sought to answer in the previously mentioned <i>Egyptian Dawn</i> was which cultures that preceded the Old Kingdom had the capacity to move stones weighing well over 100 tonnes and, based on the size and weight of some of these &#x2018;Libyan&#x2019; megaliths, he thinks he has found it. There is certainly good evidence for there being more than one game in town.</p>

<p class="indent">As a result of the changing climate that followed the end of the Ice Age, around 9,000 <small>BCE</small>, the Monsoon rains of Central Africa moved north and began to fall over southwestern Egypt, turning an arid landscape into one of savannah-style grassland and thousands of shallow pools or &#x2018;playas&#x2019; that would dry and refill again with each rainy season. The monsoonal pattern ended abruptly around 3,500 <small>BCE</small> &#x2013; and by abruptly I mean potentially in a single lifetime &#x2013; at which point this part of the Sahara became desert once more. You will note that 3,500 <small>BCE</small> is the &#x2018;accepted date&#x2019; for the emergence of civilisation in the nearby Nile Valley. Funny how these dates keep lining up.</p>
<p class="indent">Nabta Playa is the location of several dozen remarkable calendrical circles and other astronomically aligned megaliths in what is now hyper-arid desert. The earliest radiocarbon dates (from firepits, etc.) date back to around 10,000 <small>BCE</small> and end just before 3,000 <small>BCE</small>, with the majority of dates clustering around 6,000 <small>BCE</small>. (You will remember this is the same time as the first appearance of the sheep, an Indian creature, in northeast Africa.) These remains would have been left by nomadic herdspeople bringing their livestock to the area once the rains had led to the grass&#x2019;s return.</p>
<p class="indent">In <i>The Origin Map</i>, Dr Thomas Brophy undertook a meticulous examination of the astronomical alignments of some of the most prominent stones on the playa. Meticulous may be an understatement. Dr Brophy received his PhD in Physics, worked on NASA&#x2019;s Voyager project, the Japanese Space Program, worked with the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics and has been published by <i>IEEE Journal</i> and <i>Science</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">The majority of the astronomically aligned stones lie on top of, or are embedded in, playa sediment layers dating from between 6,050 <small>BCE</small> and 5,300 <small>BCE</small>. Complicating this picture is that, underneath the main complex known as the Calendar Circle, the bedrock underneath all the playa sedimentation has been deliberately shaped by human hands. The earliest layers of sedimentation were laid down around 10,000 <small>BCE</small>. (Recall that G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe&#x2019;s bedrock floor was also deliberately shaped, and at around the same time.) Inserted in between the shaped bedrock and the surface Calendar Circle, a large boulder carved in a bovine shape was discovered, buried so as to appear that it was &#x2018;standing up.&#x2019; In an article, &#x2018;The Mystery of Nabta Playa,&#x2019; contributed to special issue vol. 8, no. 6 of <i>New Dawn</i> magazine, Dr Brophy writes:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">Nabta Playa &#x2026; was filled with shallow water part of the year and the megaliths would have emerged out of the still water that may well have reflected star light along the sight lines to the observer &#x2013; that would have made the alignments easily apparent for an observer situated at the central megalithic construction.</p>

<a id="page_167"></a>
<p class="indent">Such a phenomenon would also reflect the night sky down on earth, as in a mirror (of heaven). As you probably expect, the stellar alignments of the Calendar Circle are precisely associated with the stars that make up Orion, Sirius and the circumpolar stars. The site displays evidence of being &#x2018;calendrically adjusted&#x2019; over the millennia of its use as the positions of the stars in the sky inevitably changed. Here we have a frankly astonishing example of the continuity of the association between Orion/Shepherd/Bull/Taurus being used as the principal clock of a herding culture as well as &#x2013; to my eyes &#x2013; very good evidence for how this cultural clock is folded into conceptions of a stellar afterlife. The &#x2018;clock&#x2019; that indicates the return of the rains is cosmic, after all. It keeps the beat for all of creation. If these ideas sound &#x2018;too sophisticated for a herding culture&#x2019; to your mind, it is worth remembering that, although 10,000 <small>BCE</small> is a very long time ago, it is still a further 10,000 years removed from Dr Witzel&#x2019;s proposed dating for the emergence of the Laurasian storyline, which this certainly falls into. We will return to some of Dr Brophy&#x2019;s more astonishing findings in a later chapter because they speak of the potential consciousness effects that can arise from ritually focusing on specific parts of the night sky. I highly recommend sourcing a copy of his book.</p>
<p class="indent">In the mean time, Nabta Playa is important for our story because it provides evidence for the local significance of Osiris/Orion before the advent of agriculture, with which he would later become associated. Here, I suspect he was still seen as &#x2018;the shepherd,&#x2019; the role he moved into after leaving his previous job as &#x2018;the hunter.&#x2019; By definition the teacher must predate the class, and it was believed that Osiris did indeed bring farming to mankind. Perhaps the seed-harvest-seed cycle reminded these early peoples of the actions of their resurrecting god.</p>
<p class="h4"><b>The &#x2018;Dynastic Race&#x2019;</b></p>
<p class="indent">As with Sumeria, there is a tendency to overlook the morphological and skeletal research of the past because it often carried racial implications that have not been borne out by the subsequent century of scientific research. Early Egyptologists such as Flinders Petrie discovered dramatically different skeletons in high and low-born graves at around the time the Dynastic Period was kicking off.</p>
<p class="indent">Essentially, there are marked differences in morphology between the Predynastic burials and those found in the tombs around Saqqara, Abydos and Giza from 3,500 <small>BCE</small> to 3,000 <small>BCE</small>, and even on into the Fourth Dynasty when compared to those found from the same time in Upper Egypt which are, unsurprisingly, more &#x2018;African.&#x2019; If we leave aside the scientifically useless term &#x2018;race,&#x2019; we are still left with further physical evidence that the era that gave rise to the Old Kingdom building projects was a polyglot one of domestic and international influences upon cultures moving at different
<a id="page_168"></a>
speeds; cultures which &#x2013; just to make it even less clear &#x2013; seemed to invade one another regularly and declare their own sovereignty over all.</p>
<p class="indent">In their report prepared for a controversial 1974 UNESCO symposium as part of the <i>General History of Africa</i> project (controversial because the African academics were denied access to Egyptian skin samples held in museums for pigment analysis), Diop, Obenga, Leclant and Vercoutier make the following wise observation:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">A distinction should be drawn between race and culture. In its language, writing and mentality, there is no doubt that Egyptian civilization is first and foremost African, even if, over the millenniums, it borrowed certain cultural elements from its eastern neighbours. Its population, on the other hand, is clearly a product of the Nile valley&#x2019;s position in the north-east corner of the African continent. As a corridor between central Africa and the Mediterranean, for thousands of years a crossroads between the Africa of the Atlantic and East Africa, the Africa of the Red Sea, and between Ethiopia and the Indian Ocean, it was the melting pot in which, from predynastic times, if not earlier, the various prehistoric African types, and the occasional representative of the races of the eastern marches, met and mingled. It would be a vain and useless task to look here for a pure, primitive &#x2018;race,&#x2019; or homogenous population.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">A good example of this would be mysterious Badari Culture, dating back to around 5,000 <small>BCE</small> and located about halfway down the Nile. Badarians provide the earliest evidence of agriculture in the Nile Valley, they also fished, farmed &#x2013; including (Asian) sheep &#x2013; and evidently traded widely with the Near East, South Asia and Africa: shells from the Red Sea are found in abundance, ivory jewellery and figurines from greater Africa, basalt vessels from the Nile Delta and glazed soapstone beads from southern Iran. Here is how Robert Temple describes them in <i>Egyptian Dawn</i>:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">One of the things I like about the Badarians is that they were great dog lovers. They buried their dogs with reverence, which makes them just the sort of chaps I approve of. A lot of people would have us believe that these Badarians were very primitive folk, but there is one problem: their pottery. The amazing thing is that their pottery was so brilliant that it was never really equalled or surpassed in the whole of later Egyptian history. Now, what do you make of that? What happens to the idea of &#x2018;progress&#x2019;?</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">Within the Badarian sphere of influence, at Nekhen &#x2013; better known as Hierakonpolis
<a id="page_169"></a>
&#x2013; was found the famous Narmer Palette. Dating from 3,100 <small>BCE</small> or so, it describes the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt. The monstrous imagery on the palette shows a clear Sumerian influence. Nekhen itself was the pre-eminent cult centre for Horus. By 3,400 <small>BCE</small> there may have been up to 10,000 people living in the city. All of this is to show that when we come to the re-dating of supposedly &#x2018;Old Kingdom&#x2019; sites and objects much early than the Third or Fourth Dynasty, we actually have a lot of room to &#x2018;back the truck into&#x2019; without resorting to alien or Atlantean descriptions. Sophisticated cultures had been living at scale in the area, and participating in the wider ancient world, for millennia prior to &#x2018;unification.&#x2019;</p>
<p class="indent">In a scenario redolent of the losing and accidental discovery of century-old anthropological research on Rapa Nui, the earliest depictions of &#x2018;unified royal power&#x2019; in Egypt are older than the Narmer Palette and were discovered before it, in 1890. Archibald Sayce discovered and sketched some rock drawings from Nag el-Hamdulab &#x2013; up river from Nekhen but before Elephantine &#x2013; that appear to date from 3,200 <small>BCE</small> &#x2013; Dynasty 0 &#x2013; but, based on the shape of the boats, could go back to 3,600 <small>BCE</small>. Sayce&#x2019;s sketches languished with some unpublished reports from the early twentieth century in the archive of Chicago House in Luxor until their examination in 2009. (I only accidentally found the report in the British Library while looking for something else.)</p>
<p class="indent">The inscriptions themselves are a series of six discrete vignettes depicting common royal activities such hunting, warfare and riverine or nautical processions. An unnamed king wearing the White Crown appears in three of them. He is accompanied by a dog which could suggest a Badarian influence. Unlike most rock art, which tends to begin in the centre of the available space, these vignettes start at the far right of the available flat surface and proceed to the left &#x2013; just as one finds with scribes working with papyrus. According to the authors of the report, &#x2018;The earliest representation of royal power in Egypt: the rock drawings of Nag el-Hamdulab (Aswan),&#x2019; this probably indicates the artists were used to working in other, potentially more official media. It could suggest the presence of a royal infrastructural bureaucracy &#x2013; scribes, papyri, etc. &#x2013; at a much earlier date than we currently believe.</p>
<p class="indent">Depictions of the royal boats are very compelling. In one, we see bowmen and prisoners next to a boat that has two cabins, each with a figure holding a large stick on it. The two boats in the royal nautical procession have many oars and oarsmen, are sickle-shaped, with the lower one depicting a bull standard on its prow. The lower boat has an exaggerated sickle shape with a single cabin on which stands a king wearing the White Crown. The standard on the royal barge depicts Wepwawet, the &#x2018;Opener of the Ways.&#x2019; From the same article we read:</p>
<a id="page_170"></a>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">The first tableau is the largest at Nag el-Hamdulab, and is already for that reason of primary importance. The scene is organised around five boats, four of which are grouped in a row, slanting slightly upwards to the right, while the fifth is placed at a higher position. Despite the size and importance of the boats, the focal element of the tableau is the representation of the ruler, followed by a fan-bearer, and preceded by a dog and two standard bearers, situated above the only boat with an elaborately decorated cabin. The king wears the White Crown and holds a prototypical heqa-sceptre. Four of the five boats are of the regular, &#x2018;sickle-shaped&#x2019; type. On the most elaborately drawn, not by coincidence below the king, a falcon standard can be seen, while three of the boats have a standard with bull horns. Both the falcon and the bull are royal symbols, emphasising the royal character of the boats &#x2026; In front of the royal boats are four bearded persons, their arms beside their bodies, holding a horizontal line representing a rope. Although the rope does not touch the boat, the men most likely represent people towing the boat, a theme that occurs regularly in rock art.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">Not only is the bull a royal symbol, it is also an astronomical one with resonances west toward Nabta Playa and, of course, east into Eurasia. The presence of the royal hawk is highly suggestive of Nekhen, as are the dogs. These depictions conjure in the mind a highly compelling spectacle of a victorious king, his barge pulled along from the shore by his enemies, as part of the early dynastic, biennial ritual event known as the &#x2018;Following of Horus,&#x2019; where the king would travel up and down the land, collecting taxes and generally demonstrating his kingliness. Other depictions of brewing and drinking beer, or women dancing with cattle, add to the impression of a Royal Progress throughout the land. It actually sounds quite enjoyable, assuming you were on the boat rather than pulling it.</p>
<p class="indent">The &#x2018;Following of Horus&#x2019; should be familiar to those of you with even a casual understanding of &#x2018;alternative Egyptology.&#x2019; It is very close to &#x2018;Followers of Horus&#x2019; or <i>shemsu hor</i>. The four-hieroglyph inscription at Nag el-Hamdulab can be read either way. In the now-received &#x2018;lore&#x2019; of alternative Egyptology, the shemsu hor were wisdom teachers who arrived in the land and imparted magical, legal and architectural knowledge to the indigenous population. The long length of the reign of the shemsu hor &#x2013; 23,200 years, 31,400 years &#x2013; makes it considerably more likely these are a reflection of the Laurasian &#x2018;era of the demigod rulers&#x2019; mytheme. But it is nevertheless interesting that we have unknown, vastly ancient rulers with an explicit astrotheology and clear influences from points east running the country at a time so removed from the Pharaohs of later dynasties that they may as well be mythological. I suspect that,
<a id="page_171"></a>
at least in part, the shemsu hor story reflects a cultural memory of an era prior to unification when the people of the city of Horus ran the show.</p>
<p class="h4"><b>Digging in the right place</b></p>
<p class="indent">We can back the &#x2018;story truck&#x2019; up much, much further than Manetho&#x2019;s arbitrary dynasties, but it is still generally believed that predynastic cultures such as the Badarians &#x2013; who made world-beating pottery and traded globally &#x2013; lived, for some reason, in wooden or mud houses that have no longer survived. Thus, there still remains the matter of the otherwise-instantly-appearing megalithic building projects.</p>
<p class="indent">I suspect, just as we find in India, these priceless ancient sites are unfortunately located underneath other priceless ancient sites. In 1997, Hungarian archaeologists undertook an examination of a temple on Thoth Hill, outside Thebes. Underneath the Middle Kingdom site were the remains of an Archaic Period temple aligned to Sirius. The intervening millennia meant that, thanks to the effects of precession, the two layers are slightly out of alignment with each other. Evidence of similar rebuilding has been found at Dendera and on Elephantine. We are probably looking at some regular and widely distributed repurposing of earlier sites. By the time of the Middle Kingdom, there were &#x2018;laws&#x2019; against reusing older temples. Specifically, the dead king would announce that he had not reused old temple stones while his heart was being weighed in the Court of Osiris.</p>
<p class="indent">In 2008, Juan Antonio Belmonte &#x2013; whose G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe alignments were referenced in an earlier chapter &#x2013; participated in a satellite survey of 400 sites in Egypt and the Sudan, the majority of which were astronomically aligned. Given the definitive break provided by the First Intermediate Period, the destruction it would have wrought, and the subsequent Middle Kingdom rebuilding or repurposing of earlier sacred sites, we will likely never know just when large scale megalithic projects began. We do know that mudbrick pyramids were being built in one part of the country while the magnificent Step Pyramid at Saqqara was being built in another, so again, we are dealing with different speeds of technological innovation.</p>
<p class="indent">Dating to at least the First Dynasty and presumably earlier &#x2013; not that anyone has really looked &#x2013; is the ancient &#x2018;city&#x2019; of Letopolis or &#x2018;Khem&#x2019; in Egyptian. Now buried under a decidedly unlovely Cairo suburb, it was originally sacred to Horus the Elder. Based on the research of Georges Goyon, King Farouk&#x2019;s private archaeologist and a senior fellow at the French National Centre for Scientific Research, Robert Bauval believes Letopolis was once the home of an astronomical observatory tower. Roman geographer, Strabo, specifically mentions that it was from this site, &#x2018;Eudoxus&#x2019; in the Letopolite Nome, that sightings and observations of celestial bodies was recorded.</p>
<a id="page_172"></a>
<p class="image"><a id="ch08fig15"></a><img src="images/f0172-01.jpg" class="width502" width="502" height="339" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="fig"><a href="05_Illustrations.xhtml#rch08fig15"><i><span class="fig">fig. 15</span> Isometric view of Giza Plateau, Letopolis and Heliopolis</i></a></p>
<p class="indent">Significantly, the emblem of the Letopolite Nome was the &#x2018;Bull&#x2019;s Thigh&#x2019; or Ursa Major. Bauval also points out that &#x2018;Horus of Letopolis&#x2019; was the traditional keeper of the <i>adze</i> &#x2013; shaped like the Plough &#x2013; that was used in the &#x2018;Opening of the Mouth&#x2019; ceremony.</p>
<p class="indent">These sky/ground alignments and indications of a multi-site building project across Egypt right at the very start of the dynastic period are highly suggestive of a predynastic origin for the wider cosmology that they express. Indeed, that is the entire premise of this book. Returning to Belmonte&#x2019;s archaeoastronomical survey of Egypt and the Sudan, here is what he had to say about <i>Meskhetyu</i>, the Egyptian term for Ursa Major, and its ability to confer immortality in Ancient Egyptian belief.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">The archaeoastronomy mission fieldwork in the country, particularly in the fields of pyramids, seem to confirm this fact, provided Meskhetyu could also be the principal celestial object used to align these imposing monuments as well as many other imposing temples along the Nile Valley, such as Dandara or Edfu. Consequently, the architectural arrangement of the pyramids could be a transfer on Earth of the cosmic order prevailing in the sky.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<a id="page_173"></a>
<p class="h3"><b>UNAVOIDABLE HARD SCIENCE</b></p>
<p class="indent">Too often when Egyptologists are rejecting scientifically verified dates for objects or artefacts that appear earlier than their dynastic guesswork, their response requires us to believe that there was very little going on in Egypt prior to unification. We have seen this is a patent misread of their own evidence, as well as a misread of how the Egyptians themselves saw their own history. Sandwiching enormous, interconnected building projects such as those found on the Giza Plateau into a century or less, and then refusing to budge, is a recipe for attracting <i>Ancient Aliens</i> film crews. Honestly admitting that there was significantly more cultural complexity in predynastic Egypt, and an equally significant cultural <i>continuity</i> prior to unification and the first few centuries that followed it, makes the appearance of the Old Kingdom less grotesquely aberrant, but no less inspirational.</p>
<p class="indent">The following hard scientific data (a small selection) fall outside the arbitrarily defined dynastic chronology of modern Egyptology but, owning to their status as facts rather than opinions, they must be incorporated into a proposed model of Egyptian history, lest it become entirely dysfunctional.</p>
<p class="h4"><b>Dating of the Pyramids</b></p>
<p class="indent">The fact that the Giza pyramids have actually been scientifically dated is not commonly known. In the 1980s, the University of Washington&#x2019;s Robert Wenke, working out of the American Research Center in Cairo, carbon dated some mortar &#x2013; containing charcoal, wood and reed &#x2013; from between the exterior stones of the pyramids for testing at the Southern Methodist University in Dallas and the Federal Technical University in Zurich. The dates yielded were an average of 374 years <i>older</i> than the presumed dates of the Fourth Dynasty, averaging around 3,101 <small>BCE</small> with some dates from the upper courses of the Great Pyramid yielding a date of almost 4,000 <small>BCE</small> (margin of error: 160 years).</p>
<p class="indent">More recently, Robert Temple dated the Great Pyramid to around or slightly before 3,000 <small>BCE</small>, using a dating method invented by nuclear physicist Ioannis Liritzis known as &#x2018;optical thermoluminescence.&#x2019; Whilst this cannot date the age of a stone structure &#x2013; nothing can &#x2013; it does date the last exposure to sunlight of two stones that have been pressed together which, in the case of a pyramid, is probably quite useful.</p>
<p class="indent">All of these dates cluster around the 3,100 <small>BCE</small> to 3,000 <small>BCE</small> area, centuries too old for the Fourth Dynasty and straddling that curious &#x2018;between space&#x2019; of predynasty and dynasty. As an aside, in the final years of his reign, Hawass banned all scientific dating outside of Egypt.</p>
<a id="page_174"></a>
<p class="h4"><b>Constraint Analysis</b></p>
<p class="indent">Constraint analysis is an engineering technique to determine where the bottlenecks lie in a building project. That is, which steps in a construction cannot be made to go faster and/or also hold up the rest of the project.</p>
<p class="indent">In the case of extracting an obelisk from a quarry using only dolerite pounders, the bottleneck is in the original &#x2018;dig down&#x2019; phase, which cannot be made to go faster than a single worker&#x2019;s fastest speed. Aerospace machinist, Christopher Dunn, has calculated that it would take just under 50 years to remove and shape a large, New Kingdom obelisk from a quarry using only dolerite pounders. Hatshepsut boasted of getting them out in six months.</p>
<p class="indent">With specific reference to the Great Pyramid, the descending passage, carved out of the Giza plateau&#x2019;s limestone bedrock, is only 42 inches square, meaning that only one worker at any one time could be carving it out. This provides a neat and measurable example of constraint analysis: it would have taken almost twice Khufu&#x2019;s reign for a single person to carve out this passageway using a dolerite pounder, and that is working twenty four hours a day. Not only is the pyramid too old to be a tomb, its construction cannot fit into the twenty-something year reign of Khufu.</p>
<p class="h4"><b>The Osiris Shaft</b></p>
<p class="indent">The famous &#x2018;Osiris Shaft&#x2019; beside and under the Khafre Causeway was clearly constructed in different stages across several millennia &#x2013; with the deepest layer, somewhat confusingly, being the youngest. However, in <i>Egyptian Dawn</i>, Robert Temple and Ioannis Liritzis dated the 25 tonne dacite sarcophagus in the middle chamber to the predynastic era.</p>
<p class="indent">Perhaps more interestingly, there is not a dacite vein anywhere in the continent of Africa large enough to have had a single, 25 tonne sarcophagus carved out of it, meaning this predynastic object is also an international import. Due to the properties of the stone, it is also slightly radioactive, which meant any biological material placed inside would have benefited from a mild increase in preservation, as the environment inside the sarcophagus would have been antimicrobial.</p>
<p class="indent">All of this speaks of a substantial awareness of the properties of various stones and minerals, at an extremely early date, across ancient borders. Surprising though it is on first read, it is less surprising when put into the context of the prior ten millennia or so of Laurasian megalithic spirituality.</p>
<a id="page_175"></a>
<p class="h4"><b>Further evidence in stone</b></p>
<p class="indent">Tens of thousands of pots, a great many of which date from the First Dynasty, were discovered under the Step Pyramid at Saqqara, believed to date from the Third Dynasty. Much of this pottery is made from supremely hard stone that is physically impossible to be shaped with copper.</p>
<p class="indent">Similarly, the famous and stunning statue of Khafre in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo is made of diorite, which is harder than steel. It has no tool marks.</p>
<p class="indent">Lastly, if any of the few dozen alleged new pyramids discovered via satellite and Google Earth in the western desert over the last few years turn out to be verified, then we are clearly playing an entirely different, and much older, game. As is commonly known now, the limestone of the Sphinx and its enclosure displays significant water damage over a very long period of time.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>OSIRIS</b></p>
<p class="indent">A common criticism levelled at Robert Bauval&#x2019;s Orion Correlation theory in its early days was that Osiris is not mentioned by name anywhere in the Old Kingdom before the Fifth Dynasty. How could the three main Giza pyramids represent his belt stars, then, much less the stones of Nabta Playa?</p>
<p class="indent">However, this is a misread of the available evidence. In her classic <i>The Death of Gods in Ancient Egypt</i>, Jane B. Sellers points out that not only were most, if not all, the other main characters of the Osiris myth &#x2013; Set, Isis, Horus, Anubis and Thoth &#x2013; attested to from predynastic times, but a complete telling of the story was not written down <i>anywhere</i> in all of dynastic Egypt, so its exclusion prior to the Fifth Dynasty is not all that unusual. She suggests that perhaps the story was so widely known that it was taken as given by most Egyptians. Most sources cite Plutarch for renditions of the myth, which was penned thousands of years after the end of the Old Kingdom. Here is Sellers&#x2019;s encapsulation of the story:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">Osiris was ruler of Egypt. Isis was his sister-wife, and Seth his evil brother. Seth killed his brother, Osiris, and cast his body enclosed in a coffer into the Nile. Isis rescued the coffer and hid it: Seth found it, cut up the body into fourteen pieces and scattered them about Egypt. The grieving Isis wandered all over the countryside, gathering up the parts of her husband&#x2019;s body and then, with the help of Nephthys, her sister; Anubis, the jackal-headed god of embalming; and Thoth, god of wisdom and words, put together the dismembered body, wrapping it in linen bandages and uttering sacred words, or magical spells. Then Isis fanned the body of Osiris with her wings and revived him long enough to conceive the child Horus.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<a id="page_176"></a>
<p class="indent">Further supporting the antiquity of the Osiris story are the numerous Laurasian motifs such as the duelling brothers and separation of their earth/sky parents. There are also some viscerally shamanic and probably Gondwanan layers we shall return to as well, such as the ritual dismemberment and being stored/hidden in a tree trunk. That said, by the time we reach the Pyramid Texts of the Fifth Dynasty, the legend is decidedly astrotheological, not only in the identification of Isis with Sirius and Osiris with Orion, but also Osiris&#x2019;s fourteen parts corresponding to the fourteen days of the waning moon.</p>
<p class="indent">It is certainly true that, beginning in the Middle Kingdom, Osiris took on a much more obvious role as Lord of the Underworld and Judge of Souls and Hearts. But this would be in keeping with my thesis that the newly &#x2018;democratised&#x2019; religion of the Middle Kingdom was an &#x2018;incomplete rebuild,&#x2019; following the First Intermediate Period, of a previous &#x2013; and vastly older &#x2013; elite Mystery process with very obvious shamanic roots discussed below. The analogy to Christianity is apt: it can be described as a confused assemblage of disparate Classical Mystery traditions built for a wider audience.</p>
<p class="indent">Prior to this change, Osiris&#x2019;s role was not exclusively post-mortem. The king did not merely become Osiris when he died but, as described in the Pyramid Texts, was ritually identified with him in life. This may actually reflect a shamanic need to &#x2018;claim&#x2019; the unseen world as well as the seen world as part of one&#x2019;s &#x2018;total&#x2019; realm. It was only from the Middle Kingdom onwards that he was depicted as a mummified god; a religious innovation and, I contend, an over-simplification.</p>
<p class="h4"><b>Osiris the Foreigner</b></p>
<p class="indent">Most Egyptologists would agree that that Osirian myth cycle is likely an agglomeration of mythemes: Horus/Set, Osiris/Horus and Osiris/Isis. However this awareness is less often used in an examination of the pre-Fifth Dynasty origins of Osiris.</p>
<p class="indent">Much of this is down to nomenclature. The first written example of Osiris&#x2019;s <i>later</i> name is found in the Pyramid Texts: the hieroglyphs are those of a seat and an eye. But in J. Gwyn Griffiths&#x2019;s <i>The Origins of Osiris and his Cult</i>, he notes that the earliest appearance of Osiris&#x2019;s name has three elements: the seat, the eye and, a classifier, <i>the seated bearded man</i>. The beard is a signifier of foreignness and the sitting posture one of status, so &#x2018;seated, bearded figure&#x2019; was, and remained, a signifier for &#x2018;non-slave foreigner.&#x2019; In addition, in the vast majority of cases when a toponym is mentioned in an epithet of Osiris, &#x2018;Busiris&#x2019; is mentioned, rather than his generally accepted &#x2018;home&#x2019; of Abydos. Busiris is an area of Egypt that extends north from Giza to Saqqara and encompasses several vast Old Kingdom and predynastic necropoli.</p>
<a id="page_177"></a>
<p class="indent">Given the skeletal evidence of additional cultures appearing at the beginning of the dynastic period, genetic and trade contacts tracing back millennia aross the Near East, Southern and Southeast Asia, the appearance of the constellation Orion in stone and mythological form going back tens of millennia and the belief that it was Osiris who taught mankind agriculture, just as the same constellation did in the Pacific (the same theme I believe is demonstrated at G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe) I put it to you that this little hieroglyphic qualifier may well be the proverbial finger in the dyke.</p>
<p class="indent">At this juncture, I suggest you mark a different break point in your internal chronology. Rather than starting off the story of Egypt at the First Dynasty and have it grow in complexity from there, start it with the climate events that accompanied the end of the last Ice Age, which brought new agragian species and new cultures to the Nile Valley, see it grow in cultural and technological complexity to peak around 3,100 <small>BCE</small> to 2,800 <small>BCE</small> and then have it &#x2018;decline&#x2019; for the last couple of Dynasties into the First Intermediate Period. (Consider this: a culture that only recently built the Great Pyramid would presumably be difficult to invade. A culture that had built it centuries before and was now rattling around the edges of its previously impressive monuments would be far easier to invade. Modern Britain is a good go-to example.)</p>
<p class="indent">Put the break point at the First Intermediate Period and have the &#x2018;reset&#x2019; and climb back into cultural complexity occur at the beginning of the Middle Kingdom &#x2013; with the bewildered descendants attempting to piece together a culture they had only ever heard about after one and a half centuries of violence and destruction &#x2013; and it starts to make a bit more sense.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>PYRAMIDS</b></p>
<p class="indent">So far, only two undisturbed &#x2018;burial chambers&#x2019; from the Old Kingdom pyramids have been found. The earliest and most impressive is that of Sekhemkhet, beneath his unfinished step pyramid at Saqqara. When the room was excavated in 1950, a beautiful, translucent alabaster tomb was discovered, still sealed. When opened, the sarcophagus was revealed to be empty. Atop it were the remains of plant material, suggestive of rejuvenation, and pottery discovered elsewhere in the complex referred to his Heb Sed festival.</p>
<p class="indent">The second comes from another unfinished pyramid at Zawiyet el-Aryan, near Giza, believed to &#x2018;belong&#x2019; to the Fourth Dynasty Nebka. Again, the undisturbed &#x2018;burial chamber&#x2019; contained a sarcophagus with a lid sealed with mortar and covered in clay. It was also empty.</p>
<p class="indent">Sekhemkhet was a king of the Third Dynasty, at the beginning of the Old Kingdom. The only (presumably) contemporaneous remains inside a pyramid come from the
<a id="page_178"></a>
end of the Old Kingdom, in the pyramid of Djedkare Isesi. A destroyed, granite sarcophagus and the remains of a human male of approximately fifty years were discovered inside the pyramid known as &#x2018;Beautiful is Djedkare.&#x2019; Confusingly, the age of the corpse does not align with any of the known reigns of Djedkare from the various king lists, and his wife and children are known to have been buried elsewhere, at Abusir and Giza rather than Saqqara. Other remains inside Djedkare&#x2019;s pyramid also reference his Heb Sed festival, including an alabaster vase now on display in the Mus&#x00E9;e du Louvre. That said, several of the other Sixth Dynasty pyramids near that of Djedkare Isesi have been found to contain canopic jars, suggesting that &#x2013; at least by the very end of the Old Kingdom prior to its complete collapse &#x2013; humans, and possibly royal ones, were interred in pyramids. This does not preclude the structures having some other ritual function during the life of the king, rather it suggests a cultural change that could have accompanied the general decline of society.</p>
<p class="indent">En masse, Egyptologists will insist that pyramids are the looted tombs of Old Kingdom rulers. Interrogate them individually, however &#x2013; something I have made a habit of doing in London &#x2013; and they will admit that this is really a &#x2018;best guess&#x2019; as to their function. Not only have no satisfactory remains been uncovered in any of these structures, even in cases such as those of Sekhemkhet, where the objects have remained unmolested for millennia, but we are also faced with the problem that individual kings built multiple pyramids. This is explained away as a ruse to confound tomb robbers, but the logic behind that does not stack up. Firstly, it&#x2019;s an absurd waste of resources better spent simply maintaining guards at the actual tomb. Secondly, prior to the building of pyramids, and in every era after it, there are no examples of pharaohs building &#x2018;false tombs&#x2019; in, for example, the Valley of the Kings. If this &#x2018;anti-burglary&#x2019; method was official policy, why does it only apply to pyramids?</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, we also have numerous unfinished pyramids. These are explained away by saying that the king died before his pyramid was completed. Again, this fails logical analysis. Surely the completion of a tomb is more important once a king has died? There is simply no way the next ruler, in all likelihood a relative, would have risked unbalancing Maat and attracting the ire of the gods by failing to complete construction of the tomb of his ancestor. I would go so far as to say their coronation would be illegitimate if they had behaved in such a fashion. Even in secular times, if your parents were weird enough to begin work on their tombstone prior to their death &#x2013; and then died suddenly &#x2013; you would not abandon their tombstone, you would complete it.</p>
<p class="indent">A non-funerary or at least a non-<i>exclusively</i>-funerary interpretation of the role of pyramids necessarily leads us to a re-examination of the so-called &#x2018;mortuary temples&#x2019; attached to many of these structures. A better and now more appropriate name for them would be &#x2018;royal temples&#x2019; or &#x2018;temples of the royal cult.&#x2019; Calling them such probably gets us closer to an improved understanding of their function.</p>
<a id="page_179"></a>
<p class="image"><a id="ch08fig16"></a><img src="images/f0179-01.jpg" width="100%" alt="images"/></p>

<a id="page_180"></a>
<p class="indent">Firstly, many of them appear to have been in use <i>during</i> the reign of the king, which would be unusual for a mortuary temple. Secondly, many kings built more than one. Sneferu built at least four, including one at the so-called Bent Pyramid which clearly never had a funerary function. It does make reference to the Heb Sed festival, however, and this points us in a better direction.</p>
<p class="h4"><b>Heb Sed</b></p>
<p class="indent">You are never more conscious of the paucity of magical or ritual knowledge among mainstream historians than when reading their interpretations of the Heb Sed festival. This is described as a sort of ritualised running race performed by the king in the thirtieth year of his reign and then every three or four years after that. During the Old Kingdom he would attach a tail to his garment and be presided over by priests in leopard skins, which it is reasonable to suggest are vestiges of an earlier shamanic tradition. Clearly there is something else going on besides renewing the vitality of an ageing king, especially as the festival could be held at what appear to be arbitrary times in addition to the classic thirty year interval. In his <i>Shamanic Wisdom in the Pyramid Texts</i>, Dr Jeremy Naydler puts it like so:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">A major part of the festival consisted in the king visiting the shrines of the assembled gods of Egypt. These gods, made present in their statues, were brought ceremonially to the festival site from all over Egypt. They represented the spiritual energies of the landscape, which were embodied in the human and semihuman forms of their divine statues. The king was thus engaged in a ritual communion with the spirits of the land of Egypt. The underlying purpose of this was to reach across to the more subtle spiritual world that upholds and vitalizes the physical world, in order to ensure a beneficent connection with it and an unhampered flow of energies from it to the physical.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">When you consider that the king was the divine mediator between the spirit world and the physical world for the entire country &#x2013; the state-appointed shaman, if you will &#x2013; much of the symbolism and architecture of pyramid complexes becomes clearer. The Heb Sed&#x2019;s main ritual was designed to bring the king into conscious alignment with the various forces of the spirit world and &#x2018;renew&#x2019; their terrestrial connection. Thus the final running race or &#x2018;Sed dance&#x2019; is not an assessment of an ageing king&#x2019;s cardiovascular capacity. As he crosses a courtyard laid out with symbolic waymarkers
<a id="page_181"></a>
of his kingdom this is actually a ritual revitalisation of the whole land. He crosses over all Egypt, as do the stars with which he has just been magically identified. Here is Jane B. Sellers&#x2019;s description of the Heb Sed:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">Perhaps held on the first day of the first month of the &#x2018;Season of Coming Forth&#x2019; and preceded by five days dedicated to the Osirian Mysteries, these particular rituals appear to be a renewal of the king&#x2019;s ancient right to rule both Upper and Lower Egypt &#x2026;</p>
<p class="quotei">From almost the very beginning of Egypt&#x2019;s written history we have what appears to be renderings of Sed rituals. A simple, schematic representation of First-Dynasty King Den depicts the king apparently involved in the running ceremony of &#x2018;The Dedication of the Field,&#x2019; or &#x2018;Circuit of the Wall.&#x2019; King Zoser is represented in a Third-Dynasty rendering of this same ritual, and from the Fifth Dynasty we have inscriptions from the walls of Niuserre&#x2019;s sun temple at Abu Gurob showing the king performing the same rites.</p>
<p class="quotei">A mace head of Narmer is an even earlier indication of the antiquity of the &#x2018;Hebsed&#x2019; (or Sed Festival).</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">At the conclusion of the Heb Sed, the king received a ritual coronation on a specially constructed dais, designed to represent the Primordial Mound. It was stepped, like a stairway leading up to the stars. Like a pyramid. Returning to Dr Naydler:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">The crowning itself was a cosmic event that was regarded as accomplishing the union of the Above with the Below, thereby infusing the earth with the fructifying energies of the spirit realm. This union of heaven and earth during the coronation ceremonies was accompanied by these words, spoken by an attendant priest:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote"><i>Horus appears resting on his southern throne, and there occurs a uniting of the sky to the earth</i>.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">The same formula was repeated once for each of the four cardinal directions toward which the king duly turned.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">When you consider the antiquity of the Heb Sed, its obvious astronomical and directional alignments and the association of the &#x2018;right to rule&#x2019; as well as the reordering of the cosmos with its successful completion, you see the clear parallels to Vedic and Polynesian rituals designed to accomplish precisely the same thing. (Influxes of
<a id="page_182"></a>
foreign overlords are unsurprisingly rigorous in providing themselves with magical and ceremonial legitimacy.) These parallels will only become more obvious.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>A revised architectural chronology</b></p>
<p class="indent">De-emphasising the &#x2018;funerary hypothesis&#x2019; of the purpose of pyramids invites us to consider a new chronology. Without it, we are left with:</p>
<p class="space"/><p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Predynastic Egypt: Kings buried in tombs.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Early Dynastic Egypt: Mudbrick pyramids appear. Kings remain buried in tombs.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Old Kingdom Egypt: Some kings buried in stepped pyramids, others buried near pyramids, away from the rest of their family. Tombs get larger, then much smaller, but are still only for some kings. Others continue to be buried in tombs. In the final two dynasties, writing appears inside the &#x2018;pyramid tombs&#x2019; for the first time, even though writing is attested to from actual tombs in earlier dynasties. The &#x2018;pyramid tombs&#x2019; from the final dynasty are a poor echo of some of the earlier masterpieces.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The rest of Egyptian history: Kings buried in tombs.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">If we allow that the pyramids had some ritual magical function during the life of the king, then we also have a better fit for what Robert Temple calls &#x2018;a logic of decline.&#x2019; The dating of the Great Pyramid puts much of it at or just before the dynastic era, after which the astrotheological, megalithic building project appears to get less physically ambitious; ending with some frankly underwhelming sites in the Sixth Dynasty, at which point the country was invaded and collapsed. Clearly a ritual change &#x2013; a change in the magic &#x2013; occurred in the final two dynasties with the appearance of writing, the Pyramid Texts, for the first time inside these structures, which could be interpreted as a further &#x2018;falling away&#x2019; from the original ritual function. (Think of the liturgical changes associated with various translations of the Bible.) A revised chronology beckons.</p>
<p class="indent">One final observation that may be significant before we examine these texts: if their primary purpose was not funerary, then the Egyptian pyramids would be brought back into alignment with every other Laurasian culture &#x2013; such as Sumeria and Mesoamerica &#x2013; that built them instead as calendrical &#x2018;World Mountains&#x2019; or places of ascension and descent between the upper and earthly realm. Such a realignment would be in keeping with the discovery of a proto-stepped-pyramid, Gunung Padang, in Indonesia.</p>
<p class="indent">A similar approach is called for when it comes to the Egyptian gods. As Dr Witzel observes, there were four main variants of Egyptian myth, determined at various stages in the culture&#x2019;s history by the respective priesthoods of Heliopolis, Memphis,
<a id="page_183"></a>
Hermopolis and Thebes. This resulted in specific gods assuming the &#x2018;lead actor&#x2019; role in the story. Historians and magicians are often tripped up by this, assuming there is some form of linear progression or evolution. A comparison of the four main variations quickly throws the earlier, underlying &#x2018;pan-Egyptian&#x2019; myth cycle into sharp relief.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>THE PYRAMID TEXTS</b></p>
<p class="indent">Is the Bible a funerary text? It is read at funerals. But it is also read at weddings, baptisms, state occasions, white power rallies, sporting events, during Eucharist, before procreative intercourse and &#x2013; strange as it may seem &#x2013; even just for fun.</p>
<p class="indent">Beginning with the pyramid of Unas in the Fifth Dynasty, we find carved throughout the interior of several of the final few Old Kingdom pyramids the so-called &#x2018;Pyramid Texts,&#x2019; considered among the world&#x2019;s oldest religious writings. Undoubtedly, many of the spells and incantations that comprise the Pyramid Texts have a funerary function. Our best evidence for this is the fact that a goodly number of them survive into the &#x2018;Books of the Dead&#x2019; in the New Kingdom, which is inarguably an exclusively funerary or post-mortem spell book. There is also the fact that the king is regularly referred to as &#x2018;Osiris&#x2019; in the Pyramid Texts. What is less widely known is that he is referred to as &#x2018;Horus&#x2019; equally as often, suggesting the king&#x2019;s magical identification with the divine is not exclusively related to his afterlife state.</p>
<p class="indent">Based on his PhD thesis, Dr Naydler&#x2019;s <i>Shamanic Wisdom in the Pyramid Texts</i> presents a hugely compelling argument that what we call the Pyramid Texts (PT) are related to the same spiritual function that underpins the Heb Sed; namely that the king, while living, passes into the afterlife and returns; the classic shamanic journey. Consider the following PT utterance:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote"><i>I am Horus, my father&#x2019;s heir</i>.</p>
<p class="quote"><i>I am the one who went and came back &#x2026;</i></p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">From Dr Naydler&#x2019;s book:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">Elsewhere it is as Horus that the king &#x2018;rests in life in the West (i.e., the Underworld)&#x2019; and then, like the sun, &#x2018;shines anew in the East.&#x2019; In both these passages, a nonfunerary interpretation in which the king mystically &#x2018;dies&#x2019; by entering into and then returning from the realm of the dead is just as plausible as a funerary interpretation. But however we interpret them, their existence is incontrovertible evidence that the &#x2018;dead&#x2019; king is not always an Osiris.</p>
<a id="page_184"></a>
<p class="indent">In many respects, the suggestion that the PT are exclusively funereal is stranger than suggesting their principal function was a Mystery one. Dr Naydler keenly observes that there are similar Mystery ritual practices occurring in contemporaneous cultures to the Middle and New Kingdoms, such as those of the Minoans, Hittites, and Ugarites. Given the prominence afforded to Egypt by the rest of the ancient world as the home of deep magical wisdom and power, the absence of what would become known in the Classical Age as a Mystery initiation should be more surprising than its presence.</p>
<p class="indent">In this analysis, the shamanic motifs of the PT, and indeed the majority of the pyramids themselves, are thrown into stark relief. Just as the antiquity of the Heb Sed is suggested by the therianthropic ritual garments of the king and the priests, PT descriptions suggest a &#x2018;classic&#x2019; shamanic experience. From utterance 373:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote"><i>Oho! Oho! Raise yourself up, O King; receive your head</i>,</p>
<p class="quote"><i>Collect your bones, gather your limbs together</i>,</p>
<p class="quote"><i>Throw off the earth from your flesh</i>.</p>
<p class="quote"><i>&#x2026;</i></p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote"><i>[H]e sets you at the head of the spirits, the Imperishable Stars</i>.</p>
<p class="quote"><i>Those whose seats are hidden worship you</i>,</p>
<p class="quote"><i>The Great Ones care for you, the Watchers wait upon you</i>.</p>
<p class="quote"><i>Barley is threshed for you, emmer is reaped for you</i>,</p>
<p class="quote"><i>And offering thereof is made at your monthly festivals</i>,</p>
<p class="quote"><i>Offering thereof is made at your half-monthly festivals</i>,</p>
<p class="quote"><i>Being what was commanded to be done for you by your father, Geb</i>.</p>
<p class="quote"><i>Rise up, O King, for you have not died!</i></p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">Ritual dismemberment remains a dominant motif in many initiatory traditions to this day and may ultimately date back to the very beginning of the formation of the Laurasian storyline (and perhaps earlier) where the universe is created from the dismembered parts of a giant monster or ancient god. It is quite possibly a very early conceptualisation of the microcosm/macrocosm connection of the &#x2018;unified human&#x2019; with all of Creation. The most potent visual is, of course, the removal and then return of the head, a seat of power recognised in magic and sorcery for tens of millennia, which is &#x2013; I posit &#x2013; reflected in the faceless (headless) T- shaped pillars of G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe and, of course, the &#x2018;headless hunter&#x2019; that is Orion itself. From an Egyptian ritual perspective, when Osiris is headless, he is in the Underworld. The restoration of his head corresponds with his restoration to the Living world thanks to the magic of Isis/Sirius.</p>
<a id="page_185"></a>
<p class="indent">The king is repeatedly exhorted to &#x2018;claim the throne&#x2019; of Osiris. Returning to Dr Naydler:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">Underlying the whole question of the king acquiring the throne, whether as Osiris or Horus, is the significant fact that several of the Pyramid Texts are clearly linked to, derived from, or are versions of coronation texts. Utterance 213 is illustrative:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote"><i>O King, you have not departed dead</i>,</p>
<p class="quote"><i>You have departed alive</i>.</p>
<p class="quote"><i>Sit upon the throne of Osiris, your sceptre in your hand</i>,</p>
<p class="quote"><i>That you may give orders to the living;</i></p>
<p class="quote"><i>Your lotus-bud sceptre in your hand, that you may give orders</i></p>
<p class="quote"><i>To those whose seats are hidden</i>.</p>
<p class="quote"><i>Your arms are Atum, your shoulders are Atum, your belly is Atum</i>,</p>
<p class="quote"><i>Your back is Atum, your hind-parts are Atum, your legs are Atum</i>,</p>
<p class="quote"><i>Your face is Anubis</i>.</p>
<p class="quote"><i>The Mounds of Horus serve you</i>,</p>
<p class="quote"><i>The Mounds of Set serve you</i>.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">Here, the king not only &#x2018;departs alive,&#x2019; but he does so in order to claim the throne of Osiris and &#x2018;give orders to the living.&#x2019; His dismembered body is reformed as Atum &#x2013; meaning &#x2018;complete one&#x2019; &#x2013; with the face of the god who presides over the comings and goings between the realms. As a result, the assembled forces and settlements of creation and destruction now serve him.</p>
<p class="indent">Perhaps significantly, Horus was ruler of the fertile lands and Set was ruler of the desert. Hence the utterance would not look out of place in a Heb Sed ritual where the king &#x2018;claims&#x2019; his territories. Leaving that aside, the utterance looks for all the world like the archetypal journey of the shaman into the Otherworld, his recognition there, and then his return and subsequent installation as tribal mediator between the realms. According to the early twentieth century Egyptologist, Alexandre Moret, the living king became divine precisely because he had been magically identified with Osiris; his accession to the throne required him to be &#x2018;redeemed&#x2019; as Osiris had been. The complete lack of royal mummies in the pyramids begins to make more sense in this light. Yes, the king probably got in the sarcophagus. But he also probably got back out.</p>
<p class="indent">With a particular emphasis on the Pyramid of Unas, Dr Naydler not only examines the content of the utterances, but their specific location carved onto the walls and ceilings of the various chambers of the structure. From a ritual magic perspective, this
<a id="page_186"></a>
interpretation is hugely useful, especially as it seems much more likely that the vast majority of Old Kingdom pyramids had a ritual rather than funereal role. What emerges from this analysis is a ritual space designed to accomplish the hugely important magical task of enabling the king to claim his sovereignty over the immaterial realm by a process of stellar identification, literally going up into the stars and back again, so that cosmic balance, prosperity and wellbeing are restored to Egypt. Such a goal is almost identical to the goal of the Heb Sed, which is the likely explanation for why there are so many Heb Sed motifs, depictions and ritual objects found in and around so many pyramids. And also why a king would need more than one.</p>
<p class="indent">The magical acts, in particular the identification with Orion and the intercession of Sirius (Isis), mean the king also has the &#x2018;right&#x2019; and &#x2018;magical ability&#x2019; to take his place among the Imperishable Stars upon his death. This is similar &#x2013; although much cooler, obviously &#x2013; to the way baptism ensures right of access to heaven.</p>
<p class="indent">Naydler&#x2019;s analysis of the location of utterances within Unas&#x2019;s pyramid begins with the location of the structure itself. The nine pyramids so far discovered that contain Pyramid Texts are clustered fairly close to each other at Saqqara, itself the necropolis of the Old Kingdom capital of Memphis. Since the predynastic era, Saqqara was associated with Sokar, considered by many to be an early manifestation of Osiris as well as the presiding deity of Memphis, Ptah. He writes:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">As a manifestation of Osiris, Sokar represented his power of rebirth, and was depicted as a falcon resting on, or breaking out of, a mound of earth, placed on a boat. The whole area then was as much to do with rebirth as it was to do with death.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">Significantly, Sokar combines a number of the more widespread Laurasian motifs found in Sumeria, India and the Pacific. The bird/earth/ship motif, and the implied Flood/Cosmic Waters motif, is found in the Noah story, Atrahasis and (sometimes in the form of a box of earth rather than a ship) Hindu mythology. This very likely attests to an ultimate origin sometime in the Palaeolithic, appearing in predynastic Egypt in the form of Sokar.</p>
<p class="indent">Like all Ancient Egyptian sacred structures, the choice of construction material was deliberate and fulfilled a magical purpose. The sarcophagus is carved from a single block of black basalt (the same stone used at Gunung Padang). The walls of the &#x2018;burial chamber&#x2019; are of polished alabaster, upon which many of the PT utterances are carved. Alabaster is almost translucent, and would have appeared quite evocative in the torchlight of whatever ceremonies happened in the chamber. It would also contrast with the deep black of the sarcophagus. Alabaster was referred to as <i>ankh</i>, meaning
<a id="page_187"></a>
&#x2018;life.&#x2019; Ankh was &#x2018;sap of life,&#x2019; one of the terms for milk; the &#x2018;milk of heaven&#x2019; or the &#x2018;milk of the Imperishable Stars&#x2019; is mentioned numerous times in the PT.</p>
<p class="indent">The complex would have been approached by boat across an artificial lake, arriving at the &#x2018;Valley Temple,&#x2019; before ascending the causeway into the &#x2018;Mortuary Temple&#x2019; and then into the (Hed Sed?) courtyard and around to the entrance which points north, toward the circumpolar stars.</p>
<p class="h4"><b>The Utterances of Unas</b></p>
<p class="indent">There are 228 utterances within the pyramid itself. Three are repeated several times, bringing the total number to 234. Only two straddle more than one wall. It is unlikely the number of utterances has any significance as this particular way of grouping them dates back to their first publication in 1910. Indeed, most researchers suspect a good amount of them &#x2018;run together&#x2019; rather than operate as discrete &#x2018;spells&#x2019; such as those found in the New Kingdom Books of the Dead. However, the wall positioning, especially in such a precision-aligned structure, is clearly very important. The utterances are found in the burial chamber, the antechamber, in the passage between the two, and at the end of the entrance corridor that leads down to the antechamber from outside.</p>
<p class="indent">Here is Dr Naydler&#x2019;s grouping, beginning in the sarcophagus/burial chamber and working its way out, interspersed with my commentary:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">&#x2018;<small>BURIAL&#x2019; OR SARCOPHAGUS CHAMBER</small></p>

He is then declared the &#x2018;Bull of the Sky,&#x2019; having been reborn via the cosmic cow goddess&#x2019;s Otherworld womb (Utt. 254). It continues:</p>

<p class="indent">Four thousand years later, we will never be able to reconstruct the precise ritual intention or design of any of the pyramids or their texts. Nevertheless, in light of the complete absence of interred bodies, the Heb Sed imagery found in the majority of pyramid complexes, the explicit astrotheological journey of ascending to the stars <i>and returning</i>, it is hard to argue against Dr Naydler&#x2019;s assertion that a broad ritual shape
<a id="page_193"></a>
emerges when you read the PT going from the sarcophagus out, rather than the entrance in. The balance of living/dead imagery also becomes much clearer.</p>
<p class="indent">Just as we see in the Vedas, in Sumeria and Polynesia, there is a celestial ascent, a presentation to or union with the stellar gods and then a return to earth.</p>
<p class="indent">It is quite clear that the PT is older than their first appearance on the walls of Unas&#x2019;s pyramid. Some of the grammar has even been described as archaic when compared to hieroglyphs that appear in secular use half a century before Unas. Probably the twentieth century&#x2019;s preeminent authority on the Pyramid Age, I. E. S. Edwards, believed that the stellar spells in the Pyramid Texts had an entirely separate origin to the solar spells, and that they eventually merged over time into what we call the Heliopolitan cosmology.</p>
<p class="indent">Over the course of the final few reigns of the Old Kingdom, some of the PT motifs change and later pyramids begin to incorporate more contemporaneous language. This happens at the same time as we start to see canopic jars appearing in the pyramids, suggesting they were eventually used for burial. Depending on your point of view, this is further evidence of either an inevitable mutation of cosmologies over time or &#x2018;falling away from a purer spiritual practice.&#x2019; If, as seems likely, the main purpose of the pyramids was as Heb Sed ritual zones, then we may speculate that interring the country&#x2019;s &#x2018;conduit&#x2019; between the physical and spirit realms in these &#x2018;magical window areas&#x2019; could have been triggered by the increasing unrest and invasion Egypt was no doubt experiencing as the Old Kingdom drew to a close. Perhaps it was increasing desperation that required the dead kings to become &#x2018;permanent&#x2019; intermediaries?</p>
<p class="indent">In the final dynasties, we begin to see the appearance of a few scattered PT spells appearing in non-royal tombs. These non-royal spells are the ancestors of the so-called Coffin Texts that appear in the First Intermediate Period and Middle Kingdom alongside a democratised &#x2018;afterlife for everyone&#x2019; where Osiris now sits in the Hall of Judgement and determines your posthumous fate. But it is the earlier, slightly more savage magic that is of the most interest to us, as it sheds the best light on the pyramids and rituals that preceded the Pyramid Texts.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>SAQQARA</b></p>
<p class="indent">Staying in the same area &#x2013; indeed it is right next door to Unas &#x2013; we have the famous Step Pyramid of Djoser, believed to be the earliest one built in stone. Although that sequence is contraindicated by the scientific dating performed at Giza &#x2013; suggesting that Khufu&#x2019;s pyramid may be the older &#x2013; the Step Pyramid&#x2019;s association with Djoser and thus the Third Dynasty is not in doubt.</p>
<a id="page_194"></a>
<p class="indent">Strange as it may seem to say so, the seven-levelled step pyramid is perhaps the least impressive part of Djoser&#x2019;s complex. The remarkable boundary wall, looking centuries old rather than millennia, is a true wonder of the ancient world. Encircling the boundary wall itself is something perhaps more impressive still.</p>
<p class="h4"><b>The &#x2018;Dry&#x2019; Moat</b></p>
<p class="indent">Called a dry moat because there are compartments and other structures within it, a three kilometre long channel encircles (or en-rectangles) Djoser&#x2019;s complex and was only discovered in 1985 by Egyptian archaeologist Nabil Swelim, while examining aerial photography taken during the 1920s. When in use, it would have been forty metres wide and 25 metres deep at its deepest point. Three million tonnes would have been excavated to construct the moat, which is greater than the volume of the Step Pyramid. Parts of it appear to date from the First Dynasty, which is not only astounding in and of itself, but says something important about the sanctity and <i>longevity</i> of sanctity for the land within it. One does not pick these locations on a whim. Dr Nabil Swelim observed that the moat does not connect the whole way around, but instead resembles the hieroglyph for &#x2018;battlemented enclosure,&#x2019; and that it resembles other, much smaller, moats around royal tombs from the First Dynasty. You will no doubt observe that it also pulls up right in front of the complex, meaning the king could still ritually arrive by boat. Consensus Egyptology calls this &#x2018;the Great Trench&#x2019; and &#x2018;its function seems to have been to make entry into the complex more difficult.&#x2019; Except of course that it clearly doesn&#x2019;t, and seems rather a lot of work to go toward a moat that is defensively useless. As with the rest of the complex, it is aligned 4.35 degrees off true north. There is no evidence the moat was ever filled with water, but there is not much evidence of anything, as it has never been fully excavated.</p>
<p class="h4"><b>The Boundary Wall</b></p>
<p class="indent">When considering Djoser&#x2019;s complex, it needs to be remembered that, according to accepted Egyptological chronology, this is the first instance of large-scale, monumental stone building in the country, and perhaps anywhere on earth. This is like jumping straight from the horse and buggy to Tesla Motors with no intervening steps. The boundary wall is the proverbial space ship the History Channel has been looking for.</p>
<p class="indent">Because it is not just its perfectly straight angles, corners and precision masonry, it is also that the boundary wall is a calendar calculating both the observed and actual Sothic cycle. These data have been calculated by the previously referenced astrophysicist, Thomas Brophy, and his co-author, Robert Bauval, in what is assuredly their best book, <i>Imhotep the African: Architect of the Cosmos</i>.</p>
<a id="page_195"></a>
<p class="image"><a id="ch08fig18"></a><img src="images/f0195-01.jpg" height="90%" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="fig"><a href="05_Illustrations.xhtml#rch08fig18"><i><span class="fig">fig. 18</span> Djoser complex</i></a></p>
<a id="page_196"></a>
<p class="indent">In between the 14 false doors &#x2013; to which we shall return &#x2013; there are 4,383 perfectly vertical, structurally redundant, &#x2018;panels&#x2019; around the boundary wall. However, these are not evenly distributed.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> West side: 1,461 panels</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> East side: 1,458 panels</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> North and south sides: 732 panels each (366 x 2)</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">Bauval noticed these numbers relate to the Sothic Cycle, which is the number of years it takes for Sirius to return to a heliacal rising position:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">[T]his number [1,461] represented the return of the New Year in the 365-day calendar to the heliacal rising of Sirius. But this number was arrived at by assuming an exact &#x00BC; day to add to the 365-day calendar and simply multiplying by four. In other words, this Sothic Cycle was not observed, but calculated. The true or actual length of the Sothic Cycle for the period beginning <small>C</small>. 4226 <small>BCE</small> and ending <small>C</small>. 2767 <small>BCE</small> was, in fact, worked out by British astronomer M. F. Ingham, a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society. Ingham, who was of course well aware that the length of the Sothic Cycle would change slightly due to the precession of Sirius and the Proper Motion of the star, worked out that the &#x2018;Sothic year&#x2019; (the days it took between two heliacal risings of Sirius) would have been 365.25025 days in that epoch, giving an actual Sothic Cycle of 1,458.5 &#x2026; which Ingham rounded to 1,458.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">So the western wall contains the civic calculation of a Sothic Cycle and the eastern wall contains the <i>actual</i> Sothic Cycle. As for the north and south walls, 366 was the number of days in the leap year when the heliacal rising of Sirius would resynchronise with the solar year. And, of course, there are four times 366. A leap year occurs every four years.</p>
<p class="indent">The 1,461:732 ratio of the boundary wall comes close to 2:1 and also creates an angle of 26&#x00B0;30&#x2019; which is the same angle used in the descending passage of the Step Pyramid itself, as well as some nearby mastabas. Bauval continues:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">If a rectangle is drawn within a circle representing the horizon, such that the corners of the rectangle denote the azimuths of the rising and setting sun at the solstices, then it will have the same nearly 2:1 ratio. From a metaphoric viewpoint, the rectangle would represent the domain of the sun.</p>
<p class="space"/>

<p class="indent">As for those 14 false doors? One immediately thinks of the wax/wane moon phases but also the number of pieces that Osiris was split into. It was Isis, encoded everywhere in the rest of the wall, that restored him to wholeness; a cosmic event that was no doubt re-enacted <i>within</i> her very boundary.</p>
<p class="indent">Not bad for the earliest stone structure in all of Ancient Egypt? It is at Saqqara that the inevitable fixation on the physical looks the most absurd. Just as the construction skills need to come from somewhere, so too must the story the Egyptians were telling in stone. We see here at the beginning of Egypt the lunisolar calendar we find in Egypt and Harappa, with the addition of some exciting local flavour.</p>
<p class="h4"><b>Inside the Boundary Walls</b></p>
<p class="indent">The pyramid, the boundary wall and the dry moat are all aligned 4.35 degrees off true north for reasons that will become clear. However the Saqqara site is itself evidently part of the wider Early Dynastic building project only now emerging into view. It is situated at the apex of an isosceles triangle with its base points at Letopolis &#x2013; described above as home to astronomer priests &#x2013; and Heliopolis, home of the ancient sun cult. The apex angle bisects at 16.5 degrees, which is also the angle of the sides of the Step Pyramid itself. Giza, Letopolis and Heliopolis also form a &#x2018;perfect&#x2019; right-angled triangle in this same system.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x2018;Sun cult&#x2019; only tells part of the story of Heliopolis, as the high priest was known as the &#x2018;Chief of the Astronomers&#x2019; and is depicted wearing a mantle covered in stars. In Egyptian cosmology the stars are rarely more important than during their heliacal rising, which is a solar action, obviously. Thus it seems likely that the Victorian antiquarian obsession with assuming everything is a solar cult underemphasises how interconnected these spiritual systems really are. (It is also worth remembering that our sun is, of course, a star.) The site for Djoser&#x2019;s complex was selected by Imhotep, one of the few sages of antiquity we can be reasonably certain actually existed. According to Christian Jacq, Imhotep was very likely an initiate of the Heliopolis school. Pieces of a wider plan beyond a hypothesised burial of an absolute monarch creep into view.</p>
<p class="indent">The enclosed space within the boundary walls continues their precision astrotheology. The space inside is unquestionably the site of Djoser&#x2019;s Heb Sed festival. Once again, we find no evidence of a burial anywhere, and all the depictions in the complex and pyramid relate instead to the festival. The site contains robing chambers, chapels for the various regional gods that would &#x2018;visit&#x2019; for the festival, it houses a coronation dais and the large open courtyard for the king&#x2019;s ritual running race.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two parallel rows of 24 columns inside the complex, running for 54 metres. 24 was the number of hours in an Egyptian day. The rows of columns also form
<a id="page_198"></a>
18 niches each side, for a total of 36. This is the number of decans in the sky calendar. Whilst it is commonly assumed that the decans first appeared in the Middle Kingdom, the presence of the number 36 in what Bauval refers to as &#x2018;Cape Canaveral in stone,&#x2019; right at the very beginning of the Dynastic Project suggests otherwise. We return to Jane B. Sellers:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">By 2100 <small>BCE</small>, thirty-six star gods had been set in relation to this civil calendar and these gods of the heaven appeared on coffin lids, each god occupying a specific position on the chart or sky clock for 10-day intervals, or one tenth of the sky. It has been determined that the stars chosen for this purpose occupied the zone roughly parallel to, but south of, the path of the sun, and that of these 36 decans, the star god Sahu-Orion, along with Sothis (our Sirius), was the most important.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">Putting some further context around the implications of the antiquity of the decans is Jake Stratton-Kent in his splendid <i>The Testament of Cyprian the Mage</i>:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">It is still impossible to improve on the succinct comments of Frances Yates: Into the Hellenic astrology which is the background of the philosophical Hermetica an Egyptian element had been absorbed, namely the thirty-six decans &#x2026; [which] were really Egyptian sidereal gods of time who had become absorbed in the Chaldean astrology and affiliated to the zodiac. Thus the decans originate with the ancient Egyptians, whose year began with the heliacal rising of the star Sothis (Sirius) in Cancer. The corresponding decan was attributed to Sothis, who &#x2018;looked back&#x2019; at the decans to come.[&#x2026;]</p>
<p class="quotei">Initially independent of the zodiac, in the Ptolemaic era these decans were assimilated to the Greco-Babylonian system: they have been a feature of Western astrology ever since.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">We will return to the idea in the chapters to follow, but if we find the decans, still a feature of western magic to this day, at the very beginning of the Dynastic project, then their ultimate origins are, in fact, far older than the remains of King Djoser, wherever he was buried.</p>
<p class="h4"><b>Djoser&#x2019;s Step Pyramid</b></p>
<p class="indent">If it turns out that the pyramid is much older than the boundary wall I would not be the least bit surprised. The condition of the structure is positively ruinous. My suspicion is some of its subterranean components and bottom layers are probably
<a id="page_199"></a>
predynastic and date to the time of the construction of the dry moat. First Dynasty pottery has been found in abundance inside the complex and in the pyramid itself.</p>
<p class="indent">The base of the Step Pyramid is almost square but not quite, and is slightly offset from the exact centre of the enclosure. Its subterranean features are quite impressive, dominated by a large vertical shaft and a veritable warren of corridors and niches. (Hawass estimated the total length of the corridors to be over five kilometres.) At the base of the large shaft is a granite room called the &#x2018;burial chamber,&#x2019; although there are no remains to make this case. It appears that this room had a ceiling or at least part of a ceiling of limestone blocks decorated with stars. These were removed or destroyed during one of the structure&#x2019;s ill-advised &#x2018;reconstructions.&#x2019;</p>
<p class="indent">In a more complete state, the Step Pyramid would have had seven tiers, very likely corresponding to the seven stars of Ursa Major. There is a good chance the pyramid was built in several different stages, which would be in keeping with a non-funerary interpretation, and would explain the various dimensional offsets.</p>
<p class="indent">As previously mentioned, its sides are at an angle of 16.5 degrees. Looking to the north, this means that the curious room known as the Serdab, appended to the side of the pyramid, is also at 16.5 degrees. The north-facing wall of the Serdab has two eyeholes, behind which peeped out a statue of Djoser, staring for eternity at a point in the northern sky 4.35 degrees off from truth north at a height of 16.5 degrees &#x2013; right at Alkaid, reaching its 16.5 degree azimuth just as Sirius was rising in the east.</p>
<p class="h4"><b>Alkaid</b></p>
<p class="indent">Thinking in cosmic terms, the &#x2018;Pole Star&#x2019; is more of a job title than an actual star. Due to precessional effects, the star closest to the pole changes over the millennia. During the Old Kingdom, the Pole Star was Alkaid. Curiously, it gets its name from the Arabic <i>q&#x0101;&#x2019;id bin&#x0101;t na&#x2019;sh</i>, meaning &#x2018;Leader of the Daughters of the Bier.&#x2019; There is an enigmatic suggestion of a survival of the esoteric function of Alkaid given the bier&#x2019;s association with royal funerals in Ancient Egypt.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>GIZA</b></p>
<p class="indent">Little commented upon, but probably quite important, is the geology of the Giza Plateau. It is comprised mostly of limestone, gently sloping southeast toward the Nile. The limestone itself is the remains of a reef that grew in the area when it was covered by the ocean around 50 million years ago. Rainfall or underground tributaries, when combined with carbon dioxide, erode limestone and tend to create large tunnel and cave systems when left alone for a few hundred millennia or so.</p>
<p class="indent">Tunnel and cave systems at Giza are attested to from the age of Herodotus,
<a id="page_200"></a>
through the first Victorian Egyptologists, down to seismic surveys in the late twentieth century, until the age of Hawass, who had a tendency to build padlocked metal gates over their entrances and even, in one instance, allegedly concreted entirely over one. It seems to me that the best answer to why, and potentially when, Giza became a sacred site associated with the Dead is to be found in its geology. A tunnel and cave system on the side of the river where the sun sets becomes both a map of the Underworld and the literal underworld. In fact, one of the original names for the Giza area, Rostau, means &#x2018;Mouth of the Passages,&#x2019; which is highly suggestive of subterraneity. I expect that a rational, sober analysis of subsurface Giza would show ritual use stretching back perhaps tens of millennia, as its association with the afterlife is attested to right back to the Predynastic Era. This may go some way to explaining the dramatically different dates for objects and structures found on the plateau: yes, it was a hugely important site in the Old Kingdom&#x2019;s Fourth Dynasty, but its cultic significance is vastly older still. It may even be that we could find the progression from tunnel/cave use, to <i>shaped</i> tunnels/caves, to <i>built</i> tunnels/rooms that would provide a more coherent chronology. As to how they managed to select a sacred site that sits at the cross-section of the most land anywhere on earth, thousands of years in the past, that will keep for a subsequent chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">Giza&#x2019;s spiritual significance was not just a domestic affair. We have already seen that the twenty tonne Predynastic sarcophagus in the so-called Osiris Shaft would have had to have been cut and transported from somewhere outside of Africa, but it also appears Giza was high on the ancient world&#x2019;s spiritual tourism map. What were previously called &#x2018;workers&#x2019; villages&#x2019; are now believed to have been accommodation for highborn &#x2013; and in some cases <i>foreign</i> &#x2013; visitors. Travel was perilous during the Old Kingdom and it is unlikely to have been motivated by the desire to rubberneck some distant tyrant&#x2019;s pointy tomb. A magical motive, such as the conferring of immortality in life as promised by the later Mystery traditions, is more likely. The evidence of foreign dignitaries is a better match for the idea that the Giza Plateau was known as a sacred site for a very long time. These new findings also mean Egyptologists are now, once again, missing a Fourth Dynasty workforce of tens of thousands.</p>
<p class="indent">Understanding that the wider site, rather than individual structures, had some sort of ritual significance allows us to begin to make sense of some of the dozens and dozens of mathematical interrelationships between the various pyramids, temples, and so on, because these are certainly in evidence. From the ratios of different side lengths, to the shadows cast on certain days, to &#x2018;invisible&#x2019; lines connecting various points on the pyramid, the golden angle is everywhere found. In <i>The Sphinx Mystery</i>, Robert Temple writes:</p>
<a id="page_201"></a>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">The mysterious plan of the Plateau of Giza &#x2026; is one of the most fantastic survivals of ancient Egypt, in some ways more remarkable than the pyramids themselves, since it actually embodies them within a larger scheme so complex and ingenious that it reminds me of a modern computer program run amok. And it is a plan not only in two dimensions, but three as well &#x2026; [T]he Sphinx and the Giza pyramids have a precise and direct relation with one another, a relation so specific that the monuments mutually determine one another&#x2019;s position on the plateau. They form a unified complex.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">Just some of the several dozen golden angles connecting the largest Giza structures are as follows. Temple again:</p>
<p class="space"/><p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Great Pyramid: all four corners, the top and three midpoints</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Pyramid of Chephren: all four corners, the top and two midpoints</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Pyramid of Mycerinus: two corners, the top, and one midpoint The decrease in number of the salient midpoints in the progression 3, 2, 1 matches the degree of hierarchical size of each pyramid in the group.</p>
<p class="bull">We must not forget that the Great Pyramid itself is full of golden angles and golden triangles and golden sections&#x2026; the commencement of the Grand Gallery inside the Great Pyramid is, for instance, determined by a golden triangle. The Ascending Passage and the Descending Passage inside the Great Pyramid are both golden slopes, each at the golden angle of 26&#x00B0; 33&#x2019; 54&#x201D; to the horizontal plane &#x2026; The King&#x2019;s Chamber has multiple golden angles determining its size and shape.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">Those familiar with R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz&#x2019;s Symbolist interpretation of Egyptian thought, based principally on the angles and measurements of New Kingdom temples, should not be surprised to see these same numbers and ratios appearing in the much earlier Old Kingdom. The extremity of their expression at Giza, however, is unsurpassed elsewhere and is particularly significant given how long the plateau has been a sacred site. These are old mathematics indeed. Or, as Temple writes:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">Golden angles, golden sections, golden triangles, and the Fibonacci series of numbers generated from the golden section permeated Egyptian culture for millennia and were a full-fledged priestly obsession for all those thousands of years.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">To a magician&#x2019;s eye, the ritual purpose is clear: &#x2018;resurrection mathematics&#x2019; combined with an earthly map of the stars associated with achieving posthumous immortality,
<a id="page_202"></a>
specifically Orion, built into a landscape that is simultaneously a map of the afterlife and the <i>actual</i> afterlife. That is certainly something to undertake treacherous foreign travel to experience!</p>
<p class="indent">Beyond the pyramids and the Sphinx, Giza is an archaeologically rich location. There are the three Valley temples and the so-called Sphinx Temple beside what would have been the Nile shoreline during the Old Kingdom. There are the ruined &#x2018;mortuary&#x2019; temples at the bases of the three pyramids. There are also hundreds and hundreds of Predynastic, Early Dynastic and Old Kingdom tombs, as well as many more burials from much later on in Egyptian history, right up until the Classical Age. Given the area&#x2019;s astounding antiquity and its potent magical ability to ensure one&#x2019;s survival beyond physical death, it is not hard to understand Giza&#x2019;s enduring appeal as the necropolis of choice for the discerning Egyptian.</p>
<p class="h4"><b>The Great Pyramid</b></p>
<p class="indent">The Great Pyramid was the tallest structure on earth for over four thousand years, until the building of Lincoln Cathedral in 1311. For most of recorded history it was known that Khufu was not buried inside it. This is because Herodotus, the &#x2018;father of history,&#x2019; explicitly told us so in the fifth century <small>BCE</small>:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">The pharaohs Cheops and Chephren were not buried in the pyramids that bear their names, but were rather buried elsewhere on the Giza Plateau, in their vicinity.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">This is from a man who is often the only source of information for events that happened in the Classical World in the two centuries prior to his life. As nineteenth century Egyptology began to bear out some of his previously dismissed claims about New Kingdom Egypt, we hold out hope that one day this shoe &#x2013; or Grecian sandal &#x2013; will also drop.</p>
<p class="indent">North to south and east to west, the Great Pyramid sits at the cross section of the most land above sea level anywhere on earth. Its perfectly flat base covers an area greater than 6 football pitches and it points north to within 500th of a degree, an architectural feat unmatched for millennia.</p>
<p class="indent">It is composed of more than two million stones, all of different shapes and sizes, some of them over 70 tonnes in weight. Over the course of Khufu&#x2019;s twenty year reign, workers operating in 12 hour shifts, 365 days a year, would have to quarry, carve and fit one block every two and a half minutes. By comparison, Teotihuacan, built thousands of years later, is half the size of the Great Pyramid and took 150 years to complete. In all of history, there was nothing like it and there has been nothing like it since.</p>
<a id="page_203"></a>
<p class="indent">As previously mentioned, it is impossible for this &#x2018;tomb&#x2019; to have been completed in Khufu&#x2019;s lifetime, and the scientific dating suggests it is centuries too early to have landed in his approximate reign. Nevertheless, and however much this may disappoint some readers, it shows clear evidence of having been built by humans. To my eyes, the tremendous attention to astronomic and geographic detail, as well as the resonant properties discussed below, entirely rule out the &#x2018;pyramid as tomb&#x2019; theory and the earlier dating gives us a more satisfying solve for the lack of evidence for a large, onsite workers village; a structure built over several centuries needs fewer workers at any one time, and if they were building at an even earlier date than expected then it becomes less likely that such evidence would have survived.</p>
<p class="indent">Inevitably it is a retired civil engineer, Henri Houdin, and not an Egyptologist, who has perhaps come closest to a satisfactory solve for how the Great Pyramid was constructed. In 1999, he encountered the preposterous ramp theory and quickly realised it was absurd. Houdin proposed a modified spiral ramp theory that had multiple &#x2018;chambers&#x2019; on the corners of the Great Pyramid that allowed for some of the very large stones to be turned. Although not perfect &#x2013; some of the larger stones would struggle to be turned even with the corner &#x2018;chambers&#x2019; &#x2013; the theory has some hard scientific data to support it. A 1980 thermal image of the Great Pyramid shows some low density areas that broadly match Houdin&#x2019;s &#x2018;internal ramp&#x2019; layout.</p>
<p class="indent">Houdin&#x2019;s theory has some compelling implications for the existence of additional rooms or chambers within the Great Pyramid. Firstly, there are the obvious &#x2018;corner chambers&#x2019; that would have been covered with outer stones. Secondly, according to Houdin&#x2019;s architect son, Jean-Pierre &#x2013; who built extensive 3D models supporting the theory and expounded it in <i>The Secret of the Great Pyramid</i> &#x2013; there is a secondary entrance into the King&#x2019;s Chamber at the opposite end of the wall which houses the &#x2018;main&#x2019; entrance. For the rest of the chamber, you cannot fit a razor blade between the stones. At the western end of the north wall, however, it is possible to fit &#x2018;a credit card&#x2019; between one large block and the adjacent blocks, implying this particular stone can freely move. This theoretical hidden chamber would align exactly north, in keeping with the architectural style of &#x2018;earlier&#x2019; pyramids. It may also have provided a means for getting the sarcophagus into the King&#x2019;s Chamber, as it is too large to have made it through the existing entranceway.</p>
<p class="indent">Built by humans though it was, the Great Pyramid remains truly wyrd, and the King&#x2019;s Chamber is especially so. In his provocative <i>The Giza Power Plant: Technologies of Ancient Egypt</i>, master craftsmen and aeronautics engineer Christopher Dunn suggests that the structure was a chemical and microwave-based power generator at the centre of some ancient national grid. While the hypothesis is entirely lacking in
<a id="page_204"></a>
supporting evidence, Dunn nevertheless presents some compelling scientific data that are a better match for an &#x2018;immortality ritual centre&#x2019; hypothesis, particularly when the astrotheology and golden angles are taken into account. Principally, these are the obvious harmonic and resonant qualities of the Grand Gallery and King&#x2019;s Chamber. On his website, <a href="http://gizapower.com">gizapower.com</a>, Dunn writes:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">The details of the Grand Gallery are extremely important and have no parallel in any other structure on Earth. Its geometric design predicts that sound originating within its space is focused through a passageway past the Antechamber and into the granite complex known as the King&#x2019;s Chamber. This phenomena (sic) has been noted by musicians, acoustical engineers, military scientist and laypeople alike.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">The King&#x2019;s Chamber continues this resonant theme. Firstly, it is effectively free-standing within the larger pyramid structure, with a five inch support gap between its granite walls and the surrounding limestone, as well as a floor &#x2013; which unsurprisingly &#x2018;rings&#x2019; when you walk on it &#x2013; built atop a &#x2018;corrugated&#x2019; limestone base. Returning to Christopher Dunn, again from his website:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">The acoustic qualities of the design of the upper chambers of the Great Pyramid have been referenced and confirmed by numerous visitors since the time of Napoleon, whose men discharged their pistols at the top of the Grand Gallery and noted that the explosion reverberated into the distance like rolling thunder.</p>
<p class="quotei">Striking the coffer inside the King&#x2019;s Chamber results in a deep bell-like sound of incredible and eerie beauty, and it has been a practice over the years for the Arab guides to demonstrate this resonating sound to the tourists they guide through the pyramid. This sound was included on Paul Horn&#x2019;s album, (<i>Inside The Great Pyramid</i>, Mushroom Record, Inc., L.A., CA) After being advised of the significant pitch produced by the coffer when it has been struck, and the response of the chamber to this pitch, Horn brought along a device which would give him the exact pitch and frequency. Horn tuned his flute to this tone which was emitted, which turned out to be &#x2018;A&#x2019; 438 cycles per second. In a fascinating booklet about his experiences at the Great Pyramid, Horn describes phenomena concerning the acoustic qualities of the inner chambers.</p>
<p class="quotei">&#x2018;The moment had arrived. It was time to play my flute. I thought of Ben Peitcsh from Santa Rose, California (a man who had told Mr. Horn about the pitch of the coffer) and his suggestions to strike the coffer. I leaned over and hit the inside with the fleshy part of the side of my fist. A beautiful round tone was immediately
<a id="page_205"></a>
produced. What a resonance! I remember him also saying when you hear that tone you will be &#x2018;poised in history that is ever present.&#x2019; I took the electronic tuning device I had brought along in one hand and struck the coffer again with the other and there is was - &#x2018;A&#x2019; 438, just as Ben predicted. I tuned up to this pitch and was ready to begin. (The album opens with these events so that you can hear all of these things for yourselves.)&#x2019;</p>
<p class="quotei">And, indeed, the sound, which Paul Horn brought to my living room, was most fascinating. One can understand why many people develop feelings of reverence when exposed to this sound, for it has a most soothing effect on the nerves. For this alone, the record was worth the price.</p>
<p class="quotei">&#x2018;Sitting on the floor in front of the coffer with the stereo mike in the centre of the room, I began to plan, choosing the alto flute to begin with. The echo was wonderful, about eight seconds. The chamber responded to every note equally. I waited for the echo to decay and then played again. Groups of notes would suspend and all come back as a chord. Sometimes certain notes would stick out more than others. It was always changing. I just listened and responded as if I were playing with another musician. I hadn&#x2019;t prepared anything specific to play. I was just opening myself to the moment and improvising. All of the music that evening was this way -totally improvised. Therefore, it is a true expression of the feelings that transpired.&#x2019; After noting the eerie qualities of the King&#x2019;s and Queen&#x2019;s Chambers, Paul Horn went out onto the Great Step at the top of the Grand Gallery to continue his sound test. The Grand Gallery, he reported, sounded rather flat compared with the other Chambers. He heard something remarkable at this time. He heard the music he was playing coming back to him clearly and distinctly from the King&#x2019;s Chamber. The sound was going out into the Grand Gallery and was being reflected through the passageway and reverberating inside the King&#x2019;s Chamber!</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">It is likely that the sarcophagus in the King&#x2019;s Chamber had even more potent resonant effects compared to those that are observed today. According to Robert Temple, up until the middle of the nineteenth century, a small hammer was attached by a rope to the sarcophagus, allowing visiting Victorian tourists to gently strike it and experience the reverberations. This ended one evening when a disgruntled local broke in and smashed one of its corners, feeling its vibratory effects were decidedly &#x2018;un-Muslim.&#x2019;</p>
<p class="indent">Above the King&#x2019;s Chamber are the so-called &#x2018;relief chambers,&#x2019; described as such because their speculative purpose was to relieve the weight of the stones above the King&#x2019;s Chamber. However, they are structurally redundant and only relieve their own
<a id="page_206"></a>
weight, as the cantilever roof of the King&#x2019;s Chamber does all the actual relieving. These 70 tonne granite slabs must have had another purpose. Given the hundreds of miles these slabs travelled from their quarry, granite&#x2019;s resonant properties and the spaces between each slab, we may speculate these also formed a deliberate part of the auditory/magical ritual space.</p>
<p class="indent">That the dimensions of the Great Pyramid reflect the circumference and polar radius of the earth have been known since Napoleon&#x2019;s visit, having been first calculated by Edme-Fran&#x00E7;ois Jomard in 1798. Dividing its perimeter by twice its height also yields 3.144, remarkably close to &#x03C0;. What looks like redundant complexity in the &#x2018;pointy tomb&#x2019; theory makes complete sense in the context of the wider ritual area: building a microcosm of the earth inside an astronomically aligned, golden numbered, harmonic, sky/ground map.</p>
<p class="indent">There is tantalising evidence, discussed below, that the ritual significance of the Giza Plateau &#x2013; including its planetary dimensions &#x2013; lasted at least into the New Kingdom in the form of the Book of the Dead, whereupon it just might have influenced the creation of the Hermetica and the Greek Magical Papyri, and thus the western magical tradition. First we must briefly examine the king who gave the structure its current name, Khufu.</p>
<p class="indent">Leaving aside some misspelled &#x2018;builders&#x2019; graffiti&#x2019; of dubious origin found in the &#x2018;relief chambers,&#x2019; there is nothing inside the Great Pyramid that connects it to Khufu. Outside is slightly different. The causeway connecting the Valley Temple to the &#x2018;Mortuary Temple&#x2019; at the base of the Great Pyramid contains a partial depiction of Khufu, dressed in his Heb Sed regalia; a potent indicator as to the function of the pyramid during this particular Fourth Dynasty king&#x2019;s reign. The &#x2018;Mortuary Temple&#x2019; situated at the base of the pyramid contains a large courtyard which Dr Naydler, probably correctly, believes was the site of Khufu&#x2019;s Heb Sed ritual. (Based on the <i>in situ</i> evidence of a rope pulley system, Temple believes Khufu is actually interred in a subterranean chamber underneath this courtyard, presenting us with the tantalising possibility that his tomb remains intact.) Given the lack of evidence of a posthumous relationship tying Khufu to the Great Pyramid, and the sole causeway depiction of him in Heb Sed garb, and Herodotus&#x2019;s assertion he was buried not in but near the pyramid, and the open air courtyard as part of his &#x2018;Mortuary Temple,&#x2019; the evidence invites us to assert that this particular king &#x2013; unquestionably powerful and ruling over an Old Kingdom at the peak of its influence &#x2013; conducted his Heb Sed ritual at a pre-existing sacred site, but did not actually build the area&#x2019;s most prominent structure. Given the potency of the magic baked into the Giza Plateau, he cannot be faulted for this bold decision.</p>
<p class="indent">Returning to the idea that the Great Pyramid was the preeminent structure in an
<a id="page_207"></a>
already profoundly magical landscape, we have hints of its ritual significance showing up in the New Kingdom&#x2019;s Book of the Dead, universally acknowledged as a storehouse of at least <i>some</i> of the same spells found in the Old Kingdom&#x2019;s Pyramid Texts. In particular, we have references to a &#x2018;secret map of the earth&#x2019; at Rostau (Giza). Referring to the Book of the Dead, Temple writes in <i>The Sphinx Mystery</i>:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">There are some portions of the Book of the Dead material that appear to refer to Giza. But the two most important texts about Giza are two sections of the earliest actual &#x2018;book&#x2019; of the underworld, which is now known as The Book of the Am-Duat, or The Book of What Is in the Netherworld. This was not its original title. In the text itself, its original title is given as The Book of the Hidden Chamber. [&#x2026;]</p>
<p class="quotei">The Book of the Hidden Chamber &#x2026; commences its description of Giza with a picture of a descending passage beside which stands the goddess Neith wearing the Crown of the North &#x2026; It seems reasonable to assume, therefore, that this picture refers symbolically to a northern entrance. Because the three main pyramids at Giza all have descending passages with northern entrances, and since the description is meant to be of Giza, it does not seem to be stretching a point to conclude that at least the commencement of the strange illustrations of &#x2018;the passages of Rostau&#x2019; in The Book of the Hidden Chamber begin with that simplest of things, the entrance to a major pyramid. Presumably the Great Pyramid was intended.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">From the Middle Kingdom&#x2019;s Twelfth Dynasty, we have a spell from The Book of Two Ways which makes the ritual continuity even more explicit:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">I have passed by the roads of Rostau by water and on land; these roads are those of Osiris; they are in the sky. If a man knows a Spell for going down into them, he will be like a god directed by the followers of Thoth. He will indeed go down to every heaven to which he desires to descend. But if he knows not this Spell for passing on these roads, he will fall prey to the tribunal of the dead [&#x2026;]</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">In the same Middle Kingdom text we read that &#x2018;the secret figure of the earth&#x2019; is on the surface at Giza, above the hidden chamber of Sokar. This seems fairly good evidence that not only were the dimensions of the Great Pyramid deliberately built around an understanding of our planet&#x2019;s dimensions, but also that an awareness of this deliberate dimensionality passed into the subsequent Middle and New Kingdoms.</p>
<p class="indent">After five thousand years, we may only speculate as to the form of the rituals performed at and within the Great Pyramid, but its astronomical and planetary
<a id="page_208"></a>
alignments, its resonant qualities, its deliberate use of stone, its international interest and its precision mathematics all point to them being of huge significance. We may look askance at some of the ritual content via the utterances of the Pyramid Texts. Although they arrived later, their shamanic undertones point to their antiquity and some modified form of them was presumably deployed at Giza. Heading forward in time, we see the fragmentary survival of this &#x2018;stellar immortality magic&#x2019; in the texts of the Middle Kingdom, then the New Kingdom and from there &#x2013; in an even more fragmentary form &#x2013; in the Greek Magical Papyri and thus into the western tradition.</p>
<p class="h4"><b>Khafre and Menkaure&#x2019;s Pyramids</b></p>
<p class="indent">If the pyramids are tombs, it seems clear that Fourth Dynasty kings did not suffer from penis envy. Remarkable though these structures are, they are quite literally in the shadow of their neighbour and tend to be ignored. From a ritual perspective, a few points are worth noting:</p>
<p class="space"/><p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Khafre&#x2019;s pyramid contains a granite sarcophagus with 90&#x00B0; angles so perfect you would be forgiven for thinking they were machined. They certainly were not constructed with dolerite pounders. (Menkaure&#x2019;s was lost at sea, bound for London.)</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Both pyramids have Valley Temples and &#x2018;Mortuary Temples&#x2019; with open-air courts, suggestive of further Heb Sed activity.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> As Robert Bauval noted in the early 1990s, their comparative size and location matches both the brightness and location of Orion&#x2019;s belt stars.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> There were several kings between Khufu and Menkaure, so it is almost impossible to suggest &#x2018;pointy tombs&#x2019; were a family affair.</p>
<p class="h4"><b>The Sphinx</b></p>
<p class="indent">It is now commonly known that, thanks to John Anthony West and Dr Robert Schoch, the erosion patterns on the body of the Sphinx and its enclosure have been subjected to heavy, vertical, water erosion, in addition to the horizontal wind erosion one would expect to find in an area that was desertified by the time of the Old Kingdom. This has led some people to conjecture that the entire Giza complex dates back at least 8,000 or 9,000 years; the last time Egypt was subjected to sustained, heavy rainfall; and that the Sphinx itself &#x2013; which clearly had its head recarved at least once &#x2013; was originally a lion, facing the heliacal rising of Leo on the spring equinox. As we have seen, the few pieces of scientific dating performed in the Great Pyramid or the Osiris Shaft do not bear out the suggestion that the entire site is that old.</p>
<p class="indent">The necessity to hang so much importance on a single structure has lessened with
<a id="page_209"></a>
the discovery of G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe; we now have incontrovertible proof that our Palaeolithic ancestors had a sophisticated megalithic cosmology prior to the development of towns or agriculture. In a hypothesis where the Giza Plateau is some sort of long-used, Otherworld &#x2018;ritual arena,&#x2019; it would not be unexpected to find that some of the site&#x2019;s natural features had been shaped during the Palaeolithic, and then successively reshaped in the subsequent millennia before it was eventually covered by the desert sands. Indeed, one proposed &#x2018;solve&#x2019; for Dr Schoch&#x2019;s geological evidence is Robert Temple&#x2019;s suggestion that the Sphinx&#x2019;s original shape was a jackal, Anubis, and not a lion, which is a better match for an Otherworld ritual space given the association of the jackal and the Dead. Temple&#x2019;s explanation for the (vertical) water damage is that the natural erosive properties of dew working on porous limestone &#x2013; the geological counter-hypothesis to the &#x2018;ancient rain&#x2019; theory &#x2013; was made worse by the regular dredging of the &#x2018;Sphinx Moat.&#x2019; He is probably correct about the existence of the moat, which we will discuss below, but the vertical water erosion looks to the eyes of hundreds of geologists to be the result of sustained rainfall. I propose the original Sphinx, in whatever form, was originally shaped out of the limestone during a wetter climatic period, and may even have been surrounded by water during the inundation. We know the Nile Valley was inhabited at this time, and we know that contemporaneous rock-shaping and megalithic construction were occurring elsewhere on earth, so the suggestion is not unreasonable. Then, sometime before or during the site&#x2019;s ritual use in the Early Dynastic and Old Kingdom periods, the Sphinx was a jackal, sitting in an artificial lake. The evidence for this?</p>
<p class="indent">Firstly, as most pet owners will tell you, the body shape and pose is much more canine than leonine. Once you have had this pointed out to you, it is hard to see it any other way. Remember that, over the course of Egyptian civilisation, this culture carved hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of jackals and lions. We are not talking about the first day of art school here.</p>
<p class="indent">Secondly, the Sphinx is barely visible from ground level as it has been carved into the bedrock. You will struggle to find other examples of this sort of &#x2018;hiding away&#x2019; of monumental objects. It rather defeats the point. (Doubly so if you still believe that the Fourth Dynasty kings &#x2018;picked prominent locations&#x2019; for their &#x2018;tombs&#x2019; so that everyone who saw them &#x2018;would be in awe of their power.&#x2019;) There is also the small matter of the narrow, insalubrious alleyway between the Sphinx Temple and the adjacent Valley Temple of Khafre. There is no other entrance into the Sphinx enclosure, forcing one to picture high priests and kings squeezing down it and scrambling over what Robert Temple suspects is the remains of a sluice gate. The absence of doorways into what we currently call the Sphinx Temple, plus a possible sluice gate, speaks strongly of the
<a id="page_210"></a>
sort of enclosure you would need to retain the Nile floodwater that we know made it to the eastern side of the temple during the inundation.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, given the very likely situation that the Giza complex and its magico-spiritual purpose survived in some of the spells of the Middle and New Kingdoms, it is strange that there appears to be no mention of the Sphinx in the Pyramid Texts. Well, there isn&#x2019;t if you are looking for a king-headed lion, or even just a lion. But if you are looking for a &#x2018;jackal lake&#x2019; or Anubis guarding a city of the Dead, or a giant Anubis beside a causeway, then you are in luck. Consider Utterance 268.</p>

<p class="quote"><i>He cleanses this King&#x2019;s double in the Lake of the Netherworld</i>.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">This looks suspiciously like a ritual bathing designed to mirror a nonphysical purification, the cleanings of the king&#x2019;s &#x2018;double&#x2019; in the Netherworld. There is more than a little of the Classical Mystery traditions in it.</p>

<p class="indent">Again, we are presented with fragmentary glimpses of a wider magical system designed to secure immortality through some combination of ground-based star maps, the stars themselves, the sacred use of stone and the Dead.</p>
<p class="indent">Magicians familiar with Eliphas L&#x00E9;vi&#x2019;s Four Powers of the Sphinx are earnestly encouraged to seek out Robert Temple&#x2019;s <i>The Sphinx Mystery</i>.

<p class="h4"><b>&#x2018;High&#x2019; Technology</b></p>
<p class="indent">Suggestions that the Old Kingdom had access to machine tools, electric lighting, microwave energy or any of the other examples of high technology you are likely to see on cable television, as with any other claim in this book, have an obligation of proof. And there is none. Nevertheless, a satisfactory solve is required for:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The fact that copper tools cannot shape granite at all, let alone to a precision of 1/1000th of an inch.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The sheer size of some of the stones used in the Old Kingdom, particularly at Giza.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The structurally redundant curved corners in the Valley Temples.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The use of &#x2018;marshmallow stones,&#x2019; such as those found in South America, that fit with no gaps between them and seem to &#x2018;pillow&#x2019; out.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The existence of hundreds of perfectly shaped, Early Dynastic vases and bowls made of gneiss &#x2013; one of the hardest stones in existence &#x2013; or the similarly hard statues of Old Kingdom rulers utterly devoid of toolmarks.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> And finally the simple rapidity of the construction projects.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">Since the Iron Age, and in particular since the Industrial Revolution, western culture has laboured under a &#x2018;metallic bias.&#x2019; Technology means the precision manipulation of metals. But the Old Kingdom was the inheritor and ultimate exemplar of a reverence for stone that stretched back thousands of years. Mastery of the earth and heavens was achieved and publicly demonstrated through the manipulation of stone, not metal. The evidence for this stone &#x2018;technology&#x2019; abounds:</p>
<p class="space"/><p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The resonant quality of the sarcophagus in the King&#x2019;s Chamber, &amp; the chamber itself.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The mildly radioactive quality of the dacite sarcophagus (dating to the Predynastic era), important enough to import the mineral from outside Africa. More extreme levels of radioactivity are found elsewhere on the plateau. Ioannis Liritzis, Robert Temple&#x2019;s co-researcher and a nuclear physicist in his own right, observed that the &#x2018;magazines&#x2019; inside Khafre&#x2019;s Valley Temple are so radioactive that, &#x2018;any priests working in this temple would certainly have contracted leukaemia within twenty years.&#x2019;</p>
<p class="bull">It was access to these &#x2018;magazines&#x2019; that required Robert Temple to have the lock broken on the barred gate as no one had been inside for decades.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The optical effects of alabaster and other deliberate combinations of granite, limestone, etc within the temples and pyramids. Khafre&#x2019;s causeway and Valley Temple both make extensive use of alternating alabaster and red granite blocks. Temple describes the effect in <i>Egyptian Dawn</i>:</p>
<a id="page_212"></a>
<p class="bull">Within the Valley Temple, there is a surviving enclosed stairway leading to the roof, which is of course locked and almost never entered by anyone. At first, when I went up and down this stairway I assumed that its walls were of limestone. But then I became suspicious. I pressed my torch against the wall and, sure enough, the stone round the point glowed with a golden light &#x2026; [O]riginally this enclosed stairway was a beautiful sparkling white, and if flaming torches were carried up it, a golden effulgence would have followed the bearer on all sides.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The alabaster used in the Sphinx Temple and Valley Temple does not come from the Hawara Quarry. It is made of stalactite that can only have formed inside limestone caves; caves that one would expect to find under a limestone plateau. The significance of this is often overlooked. As Temple observes, this means that during the Early Dynastic and Old Kingdom periods, the Egyptians were enlarging and shaping caverns and removing alabaster from underneath the earth at some scale, as some of the blocks sitting in the Sphinx Temple are several tonnes in weight.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">Just as with the astrotheology of the Pyramid Texts and the resonant qualities of some of the chambers of the Great Pyramid, it is impossible to reconstruct exactly what symbolic/literal effects the various stone types were intended to achieve. I am of the opinion that reconstruction is ahistorical and of limited metaphysical value, anyway. What we can say is the evidence for <i>a specific, megalithic intentionality</i> <i>is incontrovertible</i>. This should not surprise us as the Old Kingdom was the apogee of thousands of years of astro-megalithic experimentation, stretching back to the beginnings of Laurasia and potentially before. It is our culture&#x2019;s metallic bias that has prevented us from considering the mastery of stone to be of the same level of technological complexity as the mastery of iron.</p>
<p class="indent">This same bias has meant the most compelling &#x2018;solve&#x2019; for the Old Kingdom&#x2019;s mastery of stone has received little traction outside the Francophone world. Dr Joseph Davidovits, a French chemical engineer and world expert in modern and ancient concrete, suggests that much of the stone used at Giza could have been poured <i>in situ</i>. This sounds unlikely upon first hearing but the precision use of re-agglomerated stone is attested to from the Roman era, where &#x2018;wet-setting&#x2019; cement was used to build the underwater foundations and abutments for hundreds of bridges, as well as the famous occulus roof of Hadrian&#x2019;s Pantheon &#x2013; which required the cement to get lighter and lighter toward the aperture &#x2013; and is still structurally sound to this day. One wonders where the Romans got this technology from in the first place?</p>
<p class="indent">Davidovits&#x2019;s process is remarkably simple.</p>
<a id="page_213"></a>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Wadis beside the Nile were enlarged by breaking off chunks of the limestone walls which were then deposited in carved channels in the bases.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The flooding of the Nile disaggregated the &#x2018;wall chunks&#x2019; piled in these channels into clay and lime, forming a mud with all the fossil shells (lime) at the bottom.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Natron salt, found in abundance in Egypt, and extra lime from palm ash was added to this liquid, forming a caustic soda that suspends the lime within it.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> More Nile silt, limestone rubble and fossil shells were added, generating a concrete paste that was carried in baskets and poured into wooden &#x2018;block enclosures&#x2019; onsite.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">Again, it sounds strange upon first reading but the Romans did something very similar and Dr Davidovits points out that our &#x2018;metallic civilisation&#x2019; has only been aware of geopolymer processes since the 1960s. A geopolymer process provides a number of critical &#x2018;solves&#x2019;:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> There is no longer any need for giant ramps and huge workforces to carry near-hundred-tonne blocks. Baskets of concrete poured in situ are faster, and require a much smaller workforce.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The inundation that would flood the wadi quarries would occur just as the agrarian workforce had nothing else to do but wait for the floodwaters to recede back from their fields, giving access to a sufficient workforce without putting food production at risk.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Variants of this geopolymer process likely account for the complete absence of toolmarks on statues made of stone that approach diamond in their hardness. They could have come from moulds. The same would apply for the remarkable gneiss vases and other curved objects our &#x2018;metallically biased&#x2019; culture has assumed can only be constructed using machines.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Being unable to fit even a cigarette paper between separate stones, of wildly different and often frankly bizarre shape, now makes more sense if they were poured into place and then set.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">There is some very compelling scientific evidence that Dr Davidovits has come closest to working this problem out. Firstly, there are the intrusions &#x2013; hair, detritus, plant matter &#x2013; found in many of the limestone blocks, just as one finds in modern day concrete. Secondly, and &#x2013; dare I say &#x2013; incontrovertibly, is a palaeomagnetic study published in volume 43, number 6 (2012) issue of <i>Europhysics News</i>. Quoted on Dr Davidovits&#x2019;s own website, is the introduction to the article:</p>
<a id="page_214"></a>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">Our paleomagnetic investigation of the two great Egyptian pyramids, Khufu and Khafre, is based on the assumption that if the blocks were made in situ by the geopolymer concrete technique described above, then their magnetic moments would all have been parallel, oriented approximately in the north-south direction. However, if the pyramids were constructed from blocks transported from the nearby quarries, having been rotated randomly during transport and construction, then the directions of their magnetic moments would be oriented randomly.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">A majority of the samples &#x2013; though not all &#x2013; did show an alignment of magnetic moments, suggesting that the pyramids were at least partially constructed using this technique, in addition to being augmented with nearby natural limestone. These results are expected when dealing with a culture that did use specific stones for specific magical purposes and was willing to import the correct ones, such as Aswan granite or the dacite sarcophagus inside the Osiris Shaft (from who knows where).</p>
<p class="indent">In an interview that opens his book, <i>Why the Pharaohs Built the Pyramids with Fake Stones</i>, Dr Davidovits remarks:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">Not only the pyramids but other megaliths from antiquity too often present us with the same puzzles: quarries that are always several dozen kilometres away, for example, posing huge transport problems; the problems of carving these enormous blocks of stone in an age when iron is still unknown. The more I think about it, the more absurd I find the idea.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">Dr Davidovits&#x2019;s examination of the Rapa Nui geological reports leads him to conclude that the earliest Moai were made using a similar process &#x2013; recall that the quarries are &#x2018;missing&#x2019; &#x2013; and it was only the later ones that were carved from the volcanic rock. We are thus left with the compelling possibility that the &#x2018;Laurasian footprint&#x2019; covers both mythology and technology. In his essay on Davidovits, &#x2018;The Pyramid Heretic,&#x2019; the late, lamented Phil Coppens had this to say:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">Davidovits is also convinced that the method of stone making was at the origin of alchemy. The deity specifically linked with Khufu was Khnum, which means &#x2018;to bind,&#x2019; &#x2018;to join,&#x2019; &#x2018;to cement,&#x2019; &#x2018;to unite&#x2019; and which typifies the process of geopolymerisation.</p>
<p class="quotei">Egypt was seen as the birthplace of alchemy, but for Davidovits, it is also the cradle of chemistry. He argues that certain names, such as <i>mafkat</i>, which Egyptologists have been unable to translate or explain, are very much &#x2018;invented words&#x2019; &#x2013; i.e. technical terms &#x2013; as they described compounds that ancient chemists had constructed.
<a id="page_215"></a>
It is therefore not &#x2018;white powder gold,&#x2019; as authors like Laurence Gardner have argued.</p>
<p class="quotei">Davidovits argues that when Imhotep is credited as &#x2018;the inventor of the art of constructing with cut stones,&#x2019; it is actually a mistranslation of the Greek <i>xeston lithon</i>, which does not translate as &#x2018;cut stone,&#x2019; but rather means &#x2018;the action to polish stone.&#x2019; For Davidovits, Imhotep is actually the inventor of working with agglomerates, or geopolymers.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">It may be overstating it somewhat to call geopolymerisation the &#x2018;origin&#x2019; of alchemy. Since their translation more than a century ago, it has not escaped the notice of esotericists that there is a distinctly alchemical idiom to the Pyramid Texts with their reference to stones, metals and distinct processes of magical transformation. If geopolymersation was used in the Old Kingdom&#x2019;s grand, astrotheological building project it certainly becomes a part of the legend that grew over the millennia into what we now call alchemy.</p>
<p class="indent">From earlier cultures, Egypt inherited much of its star lore as well as the sanctity of stone. The innovations she brought to these beliefs were dramatically improved forms of masonry and a calendrical and mathematical sophistication that went unequalled for thousands of years. The magical efficacy of these developments, their consciousness effects, will be explored in later chapters. We may speculate here that entangling one&#x2019;s consciousness with certain stars led to certain &#x2018;inspirations/innovations,&#x2019; which improved the technology of consciousness entanglement, which led to further &#x2018;inspirations/innovations.&#x2019;</p>
<p class="indent">Think of it like a cosmic version of runaway climate change.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>EXPLICIT ASTROTHEOLOGY</b></p>
<p class="indent">There are a few pieces of explicit astrotheology that potentially tie together the pyramids, the magical formula for stellar immortality and suggest a revised time depth for their first development. Robert Bauval notes that at least three of the pyramids are named after kings-as-stars: Djedefre is a Star in the Sky, Nebka is a Star and in the case of the Step Pyramid, Horus is the Star at the Head of the Sky. When a 12th dynasty pyramidion was discovered in 1900, the head of the Egyptian Antiquities Organisation described its black granite surface as being &#x2018;polished like a mirror.&#x2019; Its eastern face addresses Horakhti, its southern addresses Anubis, its western addresses Osiris-Sokar-Ptah and the northern addresses Sah-Orion. A mirror reflecting the night sky built atop a stone map of the night sky in a country that esotericists know as &#x2018;the mirror of heaven.&#x2019;</p>
<a id="page_216"></a>
<p class="indent">Given the broad consensus that pyramids are typologically similar to obelisks in Ancient Egypt, Bauval then examines the symbolism of the <i>benben</i> &#x2013; the tip of the obelisk &#x2013; in the context of pyramidions. Obelisks are transparently phallic symbols, and &#x2018;benben&#x2019; is very similar to the Ancient Egyptian word for semen. Geb is regularly depicted with an erect phallus, inseminating the star goddess, Nuit, the mother of Osiris.</p>
<p class="indent">The magical formula that suggests itself then, is the insemination of the night sky so that the king or operant can be born as an imperishable star, perhaps the commonest refrain of the Pyramid Texts. Consider Utterance 245, where Nuit speaks to Unas:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote"><i>May you split open a place for yourself in the sky</i>,</p>
<p class="quote"><i>Among the stars of the sky</i>.</p>
<p class="quote"><i>For you are the Lone Star</i>,</p>
<p class="quote"><i>The companion of Hu</i>.</p>
<p class="quote"><i>Look down upon Osiris</i></p>
<p class="quote"><i>When he gives orders to the spirits</i>.</p>
<p class="quote"><i>You stand far above him</i>,</p>
<p class="quote"><i>You are not among them and you shall not be among them</i>.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">The immortality formula specifically associated with Nuit&#x2019;s conference of &#x2018;stellarisation&#x2019; continues into the New Kingdom&#x2019;s Books of the Dead. In the case of spell 177, it is almost word-for-word with the previous Utterance.</p>

<p class="indent">The graphically sexual nature of some of the utterances of the Pyramid Texts, as well as the inclusion of Egypt&#x2019;s version of the &#x2018;separated divine parents&#x2019; motif, the &#x2018;going up and joining&#x2019; magical journey and the spiritual function of the Heb Sed festival restoring order to the cosmos, mark the Old Kingdom building project out as a distinctively Egyptian variant of a much older motif.</p>
<p class="indent">There is a final component of the Early Dynastic/Old Kingdom stellar immortality formula worth examining for its probable early antiquity, and that is the star goddess herself. For such a critical figure in early Egyptian cosmology, there are comparatively few temples to Nuit. One possible reason for this is she is &#x2018;too far up&#x2019; the creation story and is thus more of a &#x2018;universal force&#x2019; than a goddess. There is probably something to this analysis but it is an insufficient explanation on its own. Firstly, she is actively involved in the Pyramid Text formula and there are other divine forces, such as Maat, that had temples.</p>
<p class="indent">Further evidence of her antiquity comes from an examination of her role as one part of the &#x2018;separation of earth and sky parents&#x2019; motif. At first glance, the gender reversal of the pairing &#x2013; having a female sky and male earth &#x2013; appears to be an outlier in the motif; &#x2018;earth mothers&#x2019; and &#x2018;sky fathers&#x2019; are seemingly more common. Dr Witzel accounts for the variation below:</p>

<p class="quote">The reversed position may be further elucidated by a comparison with Vedic myth. In daytime, the sky arches over the earth, like Father Heaven, stemmed up by Indra from the prostrate Mother Earth. But at night, the situation is reversed: Earth and the primordial hill or rock, on which she rests, have turned upside down and overarch
<a id="page_218"></a>
the now prostrate Heaven as the &#x2018;stone sky&#x2019; of Iranian, Hawai&#x2019;ian and Pueblo myth.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">Such an interpretation would explain not only the extremely common depiction of Nuit inside coffins but also the numerous instances of Tefnut, a Mother Earth analogue, painted on the inside of sarcophagi. The deceased is in the Underworld/stars, thus the earth is now his or her sky. Tefnut, in addition to her consort, Shu, are the conjoined couple &#x2018;the next level up&#x2019; from Geb and Nuit, suggesting a &#x2018;passing back up through the worlds&#x2019; for the deceased. Recall also that the ritual timings of the Pyramid Texts and royal mummification rituals rely on asterisms such as Orion and Sirius to rise above the horizon, to &#x2018;emerge&#x2019; from the Underworld/sky, from their Mother, Nuit. The Dead are under the earth and also in the stars.</p>
<p class="indent">Stone age carvings from Laussel show the same sexual arrangement, with a woman atop and arching over a bearded, prostrate man. From Laussel we also have the more famous sculpture of the &#x2018;goddess&#x2019; holding the moon. It appears that the Mother of Osiris, like her son, was supremely old by the time she made it to Egypt. If she was not always too old for even the very idea of temples, they would have been elsewhere, and have long since turned to dust or been lost to the waves.</p>
<p class="indent">In Egypt&#x2019;s Old Kingdom we thus see the most perfect expression of a supremely ancient idea. The spirits &#x2013; and by extension, humanity &#x2013; come from, return to and <i>are</i> the stars.</p>
