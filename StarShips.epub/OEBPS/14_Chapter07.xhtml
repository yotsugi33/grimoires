<p class="indent" style="margin-top:2em;">At this point in our story, with the exception of Antarctica, humans have occupied every continent on earth for tens of millennia. They have just undergone the most significant climate event since leaving Africa. However, postdiluvial migration &#x2013; for which we have genetic, cultural and linguistic evidence &#x2013; need not be a mass activity. To posit connections between Island Southeast Asia and the appearance of the Sumerian and Harappan civilisations is not to imply that the Sunda survivors loaded themselves onto fleets of ships and then set off for points west, populating the empty or unknown lands of the subcontinent and the Near East. Indeed, we saw that the majority of survivors largely stayed in Melanesia for the next few thousand years before permanently inhabiting the rest of the Pacific.</p>
<p class="indent">Cultures already existed in the lands that would become India, Pakistan and Arabia prior to the dramatic technological and cultural changes that we are told arose independently, simultaneously and within a few centuries of the post-Ice Age climate sta-bilisation.
<a id="page_129"></a>
Indeed, if Dr Witzel&#x2019;s timelines are correct, these cultures may have already shared a broadly Laurasian cosmology of earlier common origin by this time. Nevertheless, when it comes to the sudden appearance of cultures or cultural technology with no local antecedents, undeciphered scripts and languages entirely unrelated to those around them (but with compelling connections to cultures further afield) at a broadly simultaneous time, we have more questions than we do answers. Those answers we do have run the gamut from the highly speculative to the downright racist.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>THE SPACES BETWEEN</b></p>
<p class="indent">The creation of borders on maps throws geopolitical challenges at the future and identity political challenges at the past. It is an action that works backwards and forwards in time. The Act of Partition that created the modern states of Pakistan and India, a decision which had a widespread impact on global security, has also had a widespread impact on our understanding of the past. Today, the vast bulk of archaeological sites that comprised the Harappan and Kulli cultures are located in the nations of Pakistan, Afghanistan and parts of Southeast Iran. This means that over the last five decades or so, they have been managed by regimes with varying interest in pre-Muslim cultures and in some cases are outright hostile and destructive toward them.</p>
<p class="indent">On the other side of the border, Indian archaeology has occasionally been caught in the identity politics of both Nationalism and Independence. Indeed, the famous Harappan site of Lothal, in coastal Gujarat, was first discovered as part of a deliberate project to uncover an Indian equivalent to the ancient city of Mohenjo Daro, which fell on the Pakistani side of the border. Once again, we cannot understand history without historiography, and we cannot understand historiography without global geopolitics.</p>
<p class="indent">As is probably obvious, this state of affairs is not going to be resolved in a single chapter of an occult history book, nor will it likely be resolved in your lifetime. If you do not mind attracting a little NSA attention, it is well worth an hour or two of your time on Google Earth, looking at the various river valleys of Pakistan, western India and the shape of the coastline heading west into Iran and the wider Arabian region. You quickly become aware of just how interconnected this area would have been for cultures with even the slightest nautical competency. The same annual monsoon action that brought the Nusantao backwards and forwards from Southeast Asia enabled regular, sustained contact from India&#x2019;s southernmost tip to the Horn of Africa, up the Arabian Gulf and right along the coastlines in between.</p>
<p class="indent">Broadly speaking, we have the Dravidian/Tamil language and cultural groups in Southern India and Sri Lanka, who have genetic and linguistic connections to South-east Asia on the eastern side and genetic and (reconstructed) linguistic relationships to the Horn of Africa and Southwestern Iran to the west. These groups have a low genetic correlation to the upper reaches of the Indus Valley, where we first see evidence of the Harappan civilisation. There is effectively zero genetic correlation between Dravidian groups and Central Asia at the time depth we are looking at, and only a small correlation between Central Asia and the proto-Harappans (sending the Aryan Invasion Theory packing). The Sumerians have morphological connections to both South India and Southeast Asia (as well as the expected Semitic and African morphologies) but possess a language that is entirely unrelated to anything nearby, with the exception of Elamo-Dravidian (from Southwest Iran). Elamo-Dravidian, however, is currently only a hypothetical, reconstructed language. Domestic varieties of sheep and goat were introduced to Northeast Africa (i.e. Egypt) from Southwest Asia (Southern Pakistan and India) by 6,000 <small>BCE</small>, and if this was an overland introduction then it had to occur through almost all the areas we have just discussed. Shell trading appears to have begun in earnest over the same geographic location but potentially up to a thousand years earlier.</p>

<p class="indent">What is apparent is that probably the most important period of intercultural contact in western history currently resembles nothing so much as Dresden after the war. Mercifully, we do not need to rebuild it. It is sufficient for our purposes that there are multiple hard scientific data demonstrating contact before and after the end of the Ice Age. This enables us to examine the star lore of these areas, whether they overlap and whether &#x2013; as well as <i>when</i> &#x2013; they demonstrate increasing complexity.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>INDIA</b></p>
<p class="indent">When it comes to the origins of the &#x2018;Vedic civilisation&#x2019; and whether it originated in India or somewhere else in Central Asia, I simply do not have a dog in that particular fight. Nor is it overly relevant to an examination of mythological vectors across cultures. Its age, rather than its provenance, is what is important here. It is nevertheless worth noting that every single event described in the Vedas happens inside India, which would be unusual choice of setting for an imported mythology. (Although not entirely without precedent.) Regardless, dating an oral tradition by simply guessing it is a thousand years older than the first appearance of it in written form &#x2013; which neatly summarises the official position &#x2013; is highly dubious, particularly when the oral tradition shares so much symbolism with a culture, the Harappan civilisation, that was apparently entirely separate and ended a scant few centuries before the oral tradition began; especially when this so-called Vedic civilisation is currently missing a homeland. (Dr Witzel puts it in Bactria. I ask for actual evidence of that.) The whole thing
<a id="page_132"></a>
becomes even more dubious now that we have evidence of the longevity and fidelity of oral traditions stretching over millennia from Australia and Melanesia. It seems much more likely that it is an older, indigenous mythological tradition that arose in a culture that had a high level of foreign contact, which we know to be the case from the available genetic and cultural evidence.</p>
<p class="indent">When condensed into a single sentence, the official narrative looks rather flimsy, bordering on the absurd: some chariot-riding people we have never found, whose homeland is still missing, who are absent from the genetic record, created these hunting and fire worship hymns no earlier than 2,000 <small>BCE</small> and probably by 1,400 <small>BCE</small> somewhere in greater Punjab or a bit beyond. As mentioned, this puts its creation within a scant few centuries of the end of the Harappan civilisation to which it is apparently unrelated. But we also have no idea what language the Harappan culture spoke, nor have we deciphered their script, but it also definitely has nothing to do with the more northern Vedic language or the Dravidian language to the south.</p>
<p class="indent">The whole thing is a mess. A mess that tidies itself up considerably when you match the various motifs, flora and fauna mentioned in the hymns to the changing landscape of South Asia. The Vedas appear as the very end of a long oral tradition rather than the beginning of a written one.</p>
<p class="indent">The Gondwana/Laurasia model makes it clear that there was a sizeable overlap of cosmologies across vast land (and sea) areas. This reduces the Edwardian archaeological need to find the X on the map. Given the timeframes under discussion, it is only to be expected that the flora and fauna of the hymns would change. A picture of an oral, shamanic, Laurasian tradition changing over time emerges; changing both biospherically and linguistically.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>EURASIA AFTER THE FLOOD</b></p>
<p class="indent">When the early Indologists declared that the flora and fauna in the Vedas &#x2013; the lack of tigers in the earliest hymns, for instance &#x2013; made it unlikely they were composed in India, they were largely unaware of the biospherical changes the humans living in Eurasia had already been through, especially considering that central and southern Eurasia had been occupied for 30,000 to 40,000 years. Viewed over such a long timeline, the changes to the local ecosystem resemble nothing quite so much as watching the film <i>Baraka</i> speeded up.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <small>DURING THE ICE AGE</small>: Central Asia and Northwest India was a dry desert steppe, broadly similar to what we might find today in Mongolia.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> <small>IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ICE AGE</small>: Between 9,000 <small>BCE</small> and 8,000 <small>BCE</small>, increased rainfall
<a id="page_133"></a>
and global temperatures brought dense birch forests to these regions, closely followed by oak (mentioned in the Rig Veda). Southern India did not experience much of a climate change, perhaps only 1 degree, so the same conditions for flora and fauna continued.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> 6,000 <small>BCE</small> &#x2013; 3,000 <small>BCE</small>: The western coast of the Black Sea &#x2013; where today there are forests &#x2013; was steppe. The eastern coast &#x2013; which is today steppe &#x2013; was forest. The coasts switched to their &#x2018;modern&#x2019; configuration by 3,000 <small>BCE</small>. In the Altai region (Kazakhstan, Mongolia), the steppe became dense conifer forest at 6,000 <small>BCE</small>. In northern India, willow, juniper and oak appeared on the Kachi plain. Lake levels rose early during this period and then gradually receded.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> 2,000 <small>BCE</small>: By this point, the forests had long left the northern steppe of Central Asia, the southern steppe had become dry, northwest India was slightly cooler than it was today but otherwise largely resembled today&#x2019;s climate, as did the entire Eurasian continent.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">If Dr Witzel&#x2019;s timeline and geographic reach for Laurasian cosmologies are broadly accurate, that suggests that these climate changes were absorbed into an existing belief system, rather than being a crude reaction to local conditions. To put it another way, the same creator god was called upon in the dense conifer forests as was called upon out on the reappearing steppe.</p>
<p class="indent">Once again, recourse to hard scientific data sheds surprising new light on the development and transmission of mythology. In <i>The Origins of the World&#x2019;s Mythologies</i>, Witzel observes in passing &#x2013; and misses the potential significance of &#x2013; that, in between the Last Glacial Maximum and the end of the Ice Age, there was a grassland corridor running southeast to northwest across India up toward the Near East. To the east of this corridor there would have been marshy, predator-infested jungles and to the west there would have been impenetrable, snow-covered mountains. So there was an actual highway between our previous point of interest, Sundaland, and our current one, the top of the Indus.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>CALIBRATING THE VEDAS</b></p>
<p class="indent">In the absence of any credible evidence that the Vedas were wholly foreign to India and first created at the very young date of 1500 <small>BCE</small> by a people for whom we have zero genetic evidence and who are currently missing a homeland, it seems that calibrating the hymns with what we know of the flora and fauna described in them may shed some light on their true age.</p>
<p class="indent">What is important to realise from the outset is that they were not all written down
<a id="page_134"></a>
at the same time. First came the Rig Veda, then the Yajur Veda, then the Sama Veda and finally the Atharva Veda. The prevailing theory is that these four texts were all written down within a couple of centuries of each other. However, these timelines are in stark contrast to the dramatic changes in landscape, farming, clothing and technology described in the various hymns. If they were transcribed so close to each other, then not only are we missing their home culture, we should be looking for one that underwent the kind of changes the western world experienced over the last century. Quite simply, the numbers do not stack up.</p>
<p class="indent">Instead, we should consider that, as oral texts, the Vedas are a highly conservative form of cultural storage and are thus likely to have retained &#x2018;memories&#x2019; of ancient climates and experiences, just as we saw with the Australian Aborigines.</p>
<p class="indent">The following examples of possible calibration owe a great deal to the work of Dr Premendra Priyadarshi, Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh and &#x2013; man after my own heart &#x2013; an independent researcher with a mind for hard science. His excellent <i>In Quest of the Dates of the Vedas</i> is highly recommended for anyone with an interest in the origins of Indo-European mythology. We move from the oldest to the newest of the hymn collections.</p>
<p class="h4"><b>Rig Veda</b></p>
<p class="indent">The earliest of the Vedas does not mention wheat, rice, lentils or date palms, which is surprising given that any hypothetical Aryan hymn singer would be familiar with all of them. It would be unsurprising if these hymns represent the oral tradition of preagricultural nomads such as one might find before or at the very end of the Ice Age. Cold climate trees such as the oak, long extinct by the proposed period of Aryan influence of 2,000 <small>BCE</small> to 1,500 <small>BCE</small>, do warrant a mention.</p>
<p class="indent">Somewhat famously, the Rig Veda does describe the mighty Saraswati River &#x2013; extinct for four thousand years &#x2013; in full flow. The Saraswati lost its connection to the Himalayan glaciers around 7,000 <small>BCE</small> and gradually declined to a trickle before finally dying around 2,000 <small>BCE</small>, before the accepted date for the codification of the hymns themselves. She is described as both a mighty river and a goddess in the Rig Veda, but by the time of the youngest hymn collection, the Atharva Veda, she is described &#x2018;only&#x2019; as a goddess.</p>
<p class="indent">Staying with the liquid theme, water wheels are mentioned as being in use, suggesting that the water table in northwest India was significantly higher at the time, such as one would expect in a landscape of roaring glacial rivers. The beaver is not mentioned in the Rig Veda, but it is mentioned in the next-oldest collection, the Yajur Veda. Beavers cannot survive in fast-flowing rivers, nor are they particularly well disposed
<a id="page_135"></a>
to grasslands. They would, and indeed did, prefer the post-5,000 <small>BCE</small> climate, when the landscape was covered in dense poplar forests, perfect for building dams on the slowing Saraswati. The beaver became extinct in this area by 2,000 <small>BCE</small>, again before the accepted date for the earliest Vedic text. The creature is not mentioned again after the Yajur Veda.</p>
<p class="indent">The Rig Veda mentions lions, wild horses, wild camels and leopards, all consistent with an open grassland environment. It does not mention the tiger, the rhinoceros, the tortoise or the crocodile, which would have been absent from such an environment.</p>
<p class="indent">Of particular interest is that, unlike later Vedas, the Rig Veda makes no mention of seals, writing, pens or styluses, statues or burnt brick, all of which are present in Harappan culture, which supposedly predates it. Had the Rig Veda been composed around 2,000 <small>BCE</small> &#x2013; by whomever you wish to presume did so &#x2013; this would have been thousands of years after the introduction of such technology right across Eurasia and would presumably have made it into at least one hymn. It makes more sense to propose, as Dr Priyadarshi does, that the Rig Veda come down to us from a time before any of these things.</p>
<p class="indent">There are other technological suggestions that this may be the case. The Rig Veda makes no mention of cotton. Cotton trees are mentioned in the Yajur Veda and the Harappans, again apparently older than Vedic civilisation, wore cotton clothing. It does, however, mention wool, a far more suitable material for clothing in a land of glacial rivers and mountain passes. Recall that the sheep, an Indian animal, was introduced to Northeast Africa by 6,000 <small>BCE</small>.</p>
<p class="indent">Interestingly, Dr Priyadarshi suggests the preeminence of the fire god, Agni, in the Rig Veda above the other Vedas, would be in keeping with a culture living in a cold climate rather than a warm one. That is certainly food for thought.</p>
<p class="h4"><b>Yajur Veda</b></p>
<p class="indent">Dr Priyadarshi suggests that the Rig Veda was composed between 6,000 <small>BCE</small> to 5,500 <small>BCE</small>. After this time, the climate went from dry/cold to warm/wet which, inevitably, matches the second-oldest of the Vedas, the Yajur Veda. We see mentions of the monsoon as well as evidence for settled agriculture such as wheat, rice, lentil and date palm. This would be in keeping with the arrival of farming to northwest India in the early Holocene, a time of much higher rainfall. The rainfall was lower than today but the postglacial rivers were in full flow. Combined with the warmer climate, this is great farming weather. The era is known as either the Early Harappa or Mehrgarh Period II.</p>
<a id="page_136"></a>
<p class="indent">There are no burnt bricks in Mehrgarh Period I, just as there are no burnt bricks in the Rig Veda. By contrast, the Yajur Veda describes and also implies the extensive use of burnt bricks. Indeed, burnt bricks &#x2013; mysteriously fired at temperatures so high archaeologists do not yet know how they accomplished it &#x2013; is characteristic of High Harappan and Indus culture, beginning in earnest during Mehrgarh Period II. The Yajur Veda specifically pays homage to social classes such as sewer workers who tend drainage pipes, roads and other cultures constructed out of burnt brick. In point of fact, it is one of the most adored objects in the entire text. Combined with the climate data and the references to agriculture, the presence of burnt brick in the Yajur Veda suggests a composition date no earlier than 5,500 <small>BCE</small> and probably slightly after that.</p>
<p class="indent">Amulets, not mentioned in the Rig Veda, make their first appearance in the Yajur Veda and, as we know, Harappan civilisation was positively awash with the things. We also see the first mention of writing, another Harappan feature.</p>
<p class="indent">The water wheel is absent but the potter&#x2019;s wheel makes its first appearance here, too. The potter&#x2019;s wheel appears in the archaeological record of the region during the Mehrgarh Period II. You will not find anywhere in Eurasia where the potter&#x2019;s wheel is absent by 1,500 <small>BCE</small>, the currently accepted dating of the composition of the Vedas. So its absence from the Rig Veda, if it was composed at such a late date, is unusual to say the least.</p>
<p class="indent">Two agricultural products appear in the hymns for the first time that may be highly significant in correlating Harappa with both a Sunda influence and a Sumerian influence. Rice, which locates its genetic origin and first evidence of cultivation in island Southeast Asia, gets its first mention. That could suggest not only a change in climate making the cultivation of rice possible but also, given the broad timeline match, a diffusion of rice growing techniques from the southeast to the northwest. Mehrgargh Period II, with its burnt bricks and potters&#x2019; wheels and so on, was a time of high cultural complexity which may be due in part to outside influence.</p>
<p class="indent">The second agricultural product worth noting that makes its first appearance in the Yajur Veda is sesame, both in wild and cultivated form. Not mentioned in the Rig Veda, sesame oil became an important component of Vedic rituals. The sesame plant is summer-flowering and requires warm weather, likely originating in southern India. In fact, the Dravidian word for sesame, <i>ellu</i>, was borrowed into the Sumerian and Akkadian, and became our word &#x2018;oil.&#x2019; Burnt sesame seeds have been found in Indus sites dating back 3,500 <small>BCE</small>. Much like the appearance of the Austronesian words for &#x2018;cinnamon&#x2019; and &#x2018;lemon&#x2019; in ancient India, the use of the same word for the same substance stretching from the Dravidian region, through the Indus region and into Sumeria is compelling evidence for very early contact.</p>
<a id="page_137"></a>
<p class="h4"><b>Sama Veda and Atharva Veda</b></p>
<p class="indent">Even working to Dr Priyadarshi&#x2019;s extended timeline for the first composition of the Vedas, by the time we get to the youngest two, we are firmly within the accepted era for Mid or Late Harappa. Fascinating though these texts are in their own right, they cannot tell us much regarding potential Palaeolithic survivals.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>INDIAN STAR LORE</b></p>
<p class="indent">A curious thing happens when you map the early Vedas to the climate changes associated with the end of the Ice Age. You begin to see their star lore in a new light, but also a new context. For instance, the prominence of a lunar calendar rather than a solar one takes on additional context when you see the same calendrical system showing up among the Sunda survivors of Melanesia and Polynesia. Jake Stratton-Kent notes in his books that there is considerable academic debate as to whether the lunar calendar (and thus eventually the lunar mansions and decans) originated in either China or Babylon. Given that it also shows up in near identical form across Polynesia and, as we are about to see, is evident in the Vedas, we are forced to declare both sides wrong and posit an ultimate origin considerably earlier than 1,000 <small>BCE</small>. Otherwise this calendrical technology is unable to influence such geographically disparate cultures. They are looking for parents and actually finding siblings. The lunar calendar is clearly older, emerging from cultures that &#x2013; being pre- or non-agricultural &#x2013; had little use for the sun. It is also easier to visually track the movement of the moon through its mansions because you can actually look at it.</p>
<p class="h4"><b>Luni-Solar Calendar</b></p>
<p class="indent">A substantial minority of scholars believe that India derived its astrological and calendrical system from Mesopotamia. Evidence marshalled for this position is the Babylonian Mul.Apin Text from around 1,000 <small>BCE</small>. Like the Rig Veda, Mul.Apin has 360 days/720 &#x2018;day and night moments&#x2019; as well as an intercalary thirteenth month every five years to reset the calendar.</p>
<p class="indent">The trouble is 1,000 <small>BCE</small> is much, much too late in the story if it turns out the Rig Veda describes an oral tradition going back to at least the end of the Ice Age. An identical calendar is found in Polynesia, China, Egypt and Sumeria, suggesting its origin in the original Proto-Laurasian culture of Sundaland. There is also the not insignificant observation that Mul.Apin is principally concerned with the movement of the planets (it is Babylonian, after all) and the planets are of passing importance in Vedic star lore, just as they are in Polynesia and among the Torres Strait Islanders. (Planetary astrology achieved its high importance during the Hindu era.) If the star lore of the western
<a id="page_138"></a>
esoteric tradition derives from a Palaeolithic navigational culture, and I believe it does, then we can expect that the oldest versions of this astrological tech will place greater emphasis on the stars than the planets.</p>
<p class="indent">Two Rig Vedic hymns following on from each other describe the &#x2018;twelve fixed parts of the wheel&#x2019; in context of the sun, followed by a description of the twelve places of the moon, with a mention of the intercalary &#x2018;hidden&#x2019; month. Another hymn to the Ashvins &#x2013; who some have interpreted as Mercury and Venus given their status as wandering sunrise/sunset horsemen &#x2013; is probably the earliest description of the twelve zodiacal signs (particularly if the Rig Veda is as old as its floral and faunal descriptions suggest).</p>
<p class="indent">The system of lunar asterisms in Mul.Apin, clearly derived from the Sumerian &#x2018;three star lists,&#x2019; is very similar to the nakshatra system referred to in the Rig Veda and described in much more detail in the Atharva Veda. There were presumably 24 nakshatras &#x2013; one for each half month &#x2013; but three of them were split again to align the mansions with lunar sidereal months, bringing the total number to 27. The nakshatra system is potentially highly illuminating when it comes to the origin and true antiquity of the western esoteric tradition. Each nakshatra had a presiding deity and formed a counter-balancing pair with the nakshatra found 180 degrees away in the opposite corner of the sky, much as we find in the decans. (Yes, 27 is an odd number. There is a 28th, or hidden nakshatra called Sati, who was not invited to Shiva&#x2019;s self-sacrifice by drinking celestial poison and thus returned to the &#x2018;normal&#x2019; part of the night sky. Fudging the books is an ancient practice.)</p>
<p class="h4"><b>Pleiades</b></p>
<p class="indent">Did you think we were done with the seven sisters? Perish the thought. Just as we find in Polynesia, the year begins with the heliacal rising of the Krittikas in the east. However, thanks to the impact of precession, it seems highly likely the Pleiades were spiritually significant long before taking up position in the eastern corner of the dawn sky, which would be in keeping with the proposed true age of the Rig Veda.</p>
<p class="indent">Dr B. G. Sidharth, an astronomer with some thirty years&#x2019; experience and director of India&#x2019;s B. M. Birla Science Centre has matched mentions of the sky location of different asterisms in the Vedas to when they last occupied said locations and come up with a date of 7,300 <small>BCE</small> for the Vedic age. In his fascinating book, <i>The Celestial Key to the Vedas</i>, he avers these hymns describe a <i>continuous system of astronomical observation</i> going back to 7,300 <small>BCE</small> and beyond, rather than a system formed at such an early date that was subsequently passed down. His description of a corpus of star lore growing in sophistication is in almost perfect agreement with Dr Priyadarshi&#x2019;s mapping
<a id="page_139"></a>
of the changing flora, fauna and technology found in the Rig Veda and the Yajur Veda.</p>
<p class="indent">Dr Sidharth draws our attention to a Rig Vedic hymn in which Prajapati, the year, begins with the nakshatra Rohini rising at the winter solstice at the same time Antares rose at the summer solstice and the nakshatra Purva Bhadrapada rose with the autumnal equinox. For all these conditions to be met, we are looking at 10,000 <small>BCE</small>, mid-point of Dr Witzel&#x2019;s Laurasian storyline and contemporaneous with the probably-astronomical temple of G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe. In the Mahabharata, composed much later than the Rig Veda, this same sky pattern is referenced again. Indra &#x2013; the presiding ruler of the nakshatra Rohini &#x2013; yields his place &#x2018;at the head of the gods&#x2019; to Karttikeya, ruling deity of Krittikas. Due to precession, Aldebaran (Rohini) moved from its winter solstice position to be replaced by the Pleiades (Krittikas) at around 8,500 <small>BCE</small>. Further corroboration of these early dates comes from commentaries on the Rig Veda that describe the Krittikas as &#x2018;first of the divine stars,&#x2019; i.e. rising at the winter solstice, and end with Vishakha (Libra) at the summer solstice.</p>
<p class="indent">Viewed with the eyes of a practical occultist, what is interesting is that the asterism as well as the directionality are equally important. Later Vedic texts describe the Krittikas as &#x2018;never swerving from the east,&#x2019; which is very difficult to do over such a long timeline unless you start celebrating the heliacal rising of the Pleiades on a different quarter day. Indeed, the University of Helsinki&#x2019;s Asko Parpola has found a number of cultural references that tie the Pleiades to the autumnal equinox and potentially to Harappan ritual, bringing us to 3,000 <small>BCE</small> and landing us back in Dr Priyadarshi&#x2019;s timeline. This will be discussed below. Dr Sidharth sees meaning in a curious passage in the (much later) Mahabharata where the age of the Krittikas came to an end. The people wanted it to return and convinced the deity to do so. This may be a cultural expression of the Pleiades leaving one quarter day and then appearing on another, millennia later.</p>
<p class="indent">As expected, there is a Seven Sages/seven wives/banished to the sky motif in the Vedic descriptions of the Pleiades, just as we find in the Pacific. There is a component to this motif that is probably highly significant. After a confusing birth story involving Agni&#x2019;s wife impersonating six of the wives of the Seven Sages because her husband wanted to bed them, she is impregnated by Agni and gives birth to Karttikeya, who is then raised by the actual wives of the Seven Sages in the sky/in the Pleiades. Karttikeya rides a peacock, native to southern India, and the &#x2018;eyes&#x2019; in its plumage probably represent the stars of Pleiades. (Recall that in the Pacific, &#x2018;Matariki&#x2019; is known as &#x2018;little eyes.&#x2019;) Peacock and star motifs are prominent on pottery in some late Harappan burial sites. Moving into historical times, Karttikeya &#x2013; known as Murugan &#x2013; was and is immensely popular in Southern and Tamil regions, right across to Singapore. He is
<a id="page_140"></a>
commander-in-chief of the army of the gods and &#x2018;precedes&#x2019; them, just as the Pleiades appear first of all the constellations. That the Pleiades would be so popular in the southern parts of the subcontinent would be in keeping with any potential influence from Island Southeast Asia at an early date, especially if the &#x2018;little eyes&#x2019; component is factored in.</p>
<p class="indent">And if your mind has already landed on peacock angels and various &#x2018;birds on sticks&#x2019; survivals from further north in Eurasia, then you are already several chapters ahead.</p>
<p class="h4"><b>Stellar Fish</b></p>
<p class="indent">Staying in areas of Tamil influence for the moment, we quote from Asko Parpola&#x2019;s &#x2018;Beginnings of Indian Astronomy with Reference to a Parallel Development in China&#x2019;:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">Native Dravidian names of stars, asterisms and planets preserved in Old Tamil texts can be read in the logo-syllabic Indus script, where the most common Dravidian word for &#x2018;star,&#x2019; <i>m&#x012B;&#x0146;</i>, is expressed with the picture of its homonym <i>m&#x012B;n</i> &#x2018;fish.&#x2019;</p>
<p class="quotei">Among the Dravidian star names ending in <i>m&#x012B;n</i> that are attested to in Old Tamil is <i>va&#x0163;a-m&#x012B;&#x0146;</i> &#x2018;north star&#x2019;; this compound has a counterpart in the Indus script, where a pictogram resembling the &#x2018;three-branched fig tree&#x2019; motif of Harappan painted pottery occurs several times immediately before the plain &#x2018;fish&#x2019; sign. A homonym of <i>va&#x0163;a</i> &#x2018;north&#x2019; is <i>va&#x0163;am</i> &#x2018;banyan fig,&#x2019; the mighty tree with rope-like air-roots from which it has got its name. This Dravidian homonymy explains two conceptions of Puranic cosmology, the banyan as the tree of the northern direction and the idea that stars and planets are tied to the pole star with invisible &#x2018;ropes of wind.&#x2019; As early as in &#x0156;gveda 1,24, reference is made to stars being &#x2018;fixed above&#x2019; and to a banyan tree held up in the sky by King Varuna.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">Fig and fish combinations recur in seals and pottery right across the Harappan age. Found at Mohenjo-Daro, seal H-179 depicts a humanoid deity <i>inside</i> a fig tree, flanked by fish. This has echoes backwards into the Laurasian motif of tree burial/tree spirits, and forwards into the Osiris myth. The continuity of these motifs backwards from Old Tamil into both Harappan artefacts and the Rig Veda tells us several very important things. Firstly, it demonstrates that the Indus culture very likely spoke a form of Proto-Dravidian. Secondly, it is further evidence connecting the Rig Veda to Harappan culture. Thirdly, it demonstrates that these probably extremely ancient motifs have survived in recognisable form into the historical period (which is the whole point of this book, of course).</p>
<p class="indent">Finally &#x2013; and I think most significantly &#x2013; we have the explicit connection between
<a id="page_141"></a>
stars and fish. Parpola believes the fish/star <i>min</i> derives from the Proto-Dravidian word for &#x2018;to flash, shine, glitter.&#x2019; On my childhood trips to Fiji I would watch schools of juvenile barracuda from the edge of a jetty after supper. On a clear evening, it is not hard to see where the association comes from. It also recalls to mind the fishing/canoe motifs of the Pacific, the Milky Way as river (much as the celestial Ganges pours down on Shiva&#x2019;s head) and, crucially, provides an important solution to the &#x2018;Seven Sages dressed as fish-men&#x2019; motif encountered in Sumeria. These aren&#x2019;t space-suits. The sages are the stars and, specifically, they are probably the Pleiades. The &#x2018;night sky as ocean with heavenly rivers and heavenly fish&#x2019; also survives into the Babylonian phase.</p>
<p class="indent">Fish were a common pottery motif from the earliest Harappan periods and are among the most common signs in the Indus script. The Sumerian script had a pictogram for &#x2018;star&#x2019; and so did not use &#x2018;fish&#x2019; in its place. Sumerian depictions locate the star pictogram near the heads of divinities to denote their divine origin. If &#x2018;fish&#x2019; and &#x2018;star&#x2019; were interchangeable in Harappa and the Indus culture, then the exact same practice emerges. This would explain why the famous &#x2018;Master of the Animals&#x2019; seal from Mohenjo Daro has two fishes next to his head. It also invites us to some very specific interpretations of many other seals. Consider seal H-9 below, referenced in the same article by Parpola.</p>
<p class="image"><a id="ch07fig12"></a><img src="images/f0141-01.jpg" class="width323" width="323" height="315" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="fig"><a href="05_Illustrations.xhtml#rch07fig12"><i><span class="fig">fig. 12</span> Seal H-9 from Harappa. (Image courtesy Archaeological Survey of India)</i></a></p>
<a id="page_142"></a>
<p class="indent">It has the number seven, then fish. Interestingly, it also has a bull. The Pleiades, as you know, constitute part of the constellation of Taurus. But is there evidence for the existence of the Classical astrological constellations at this time depth?</p>
<p class="h4"><b>Other Constellations</b></p>
<p class="indent">In the later Babylonian texts, the names used for recognisable constellations are all Sumerian, with the prefix <i>mul</i>, meaning star. For instance:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Mul.Ur.Gu.La &#x2013; Star lion</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Mul.Gir.Tab &#x2013; Star scorpion</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Mul.Gu.An.Na &#x2013; Bull of the sky/stars</p>
<p class="indent">These names suggest that at least some of the classical astrological system had been developed by the third millennium <small>BCE</small> at the latest. It is with this insight that we can look at some of the Harappan seals and iconography; specifically the Proto-Shiva seal M-304 from Mohenjo Daro. It depicts a horned figure sitting in a yogic pose with some undeciphered glyphs, including a fish, running along the top. Commonly described as having three faces, a better interpretation is that the Proto-Shiva has four faces, with the fourth facing away from the viewer.</p>
<p class="image"><a id="ch07fig13"></a><img src="images/f0142-01.jpg" class="width322" width="322" height="315" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="fig"><a href="05_Illustrations.xhtml#rch07fig13"><i><span class="fig">fig. 13</span> The four-faced &#x2018;Proto-Shiva&#x2019; on seal M-304. (Image courtesy National Museum of India)</i></a></p>
<a id="page_143"></a>
<p class="indent">Such an interpretation sheds new light on the four animals surrounding him, making them guardians of the four directions, expressed as constellations. This would align not only with Vedic and Harappan rituals &#x2013; discussed below &#x2013; that involve the king facing toward or marking the four directions, but would also bring the artefact into alignment with subsequent depictions of various Hindu gods.</p>
<p class="indent">The so-called &#x2018;mother goddess&#x2019; seal found in the Northwest Indian site of Kalibangan depicts a decidedly unmatronly female &#x2013; some might say virginal &#x2013; seated atop a lion. The constellation Virgo appears above Leo. Possibly adding further emphasis to this analysis is the presence of a water carrier in the top left; the yoke across his shoulders looks decidedly well-balanced, like scales.</p>
<p class="h4"><b>Very Large Numbers</b></p>
<p class="indent">Returning to Dr Sidharth&#x2019;s research, he describes some of the very elaborate mathematics found in the Vedas which, along with the fish/star symbolism, have implications for how we interpret &#x2013; and have historically misinterpreted &#x2013; the tremendous antiquity of the first Sumerian rulers, among others. They suggest a level of astronomical complexity far in advance of what is commonly expected and, conveniently for the thesis of this book, line up precisely with when we would expect to find the influence of sophisticated climate refugees arriving from points east. Read through this a couple of times.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> We know that a year is 360 days. A <i>divine</i> year is 360 earth years, scaling up from the human to the gods.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> There are 12,000 divine years in each yuga, or Great Age (we live in the Kali Yuga), which is divisible by the 12 stations/asterisms of the sun.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Each yuga/Great Age is thus 4,320,000 <i>earth</i> years, and each one is divided into four eras whose ratio diminishes, 4:3:2:1. (The same number, 4,320,000 appears in Sumeria when describing the ages and lifetimes of antediluvian kings, suggesting a shared origin of high astronomical mathematics.)</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Each of these four &#x2018;sub eras&#x2019; consists of a main section and two subsections, like dawn and twilight, that are both 10% of the total time. So the Krita Yuga is 4,000 divine years, with a 400 divine year period before and after it. The next Yuga is 3,000 divine years with two 300 divine year windows on either side, and so on.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Dr Sidharth notes that this &#x2018;10% on either side&#x2019; feature actually matches real twilight on earth: sunrise and sunset are the periods when the sun is less than 18 degrees below the horizon, and it obviously makes a 180 degree journey through the sky each day.</p>
<a id="page_144"></a>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> There is one final compelling numerical relationship to consider: A full day is 86,400 seconds, meaning a day and a night period are composed of 43,200 seconds each.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">There is more, specifically to do with the Vedic awareness of the extremely long cycles of eclipses. From <i>The Celestial Key to the Vedas</i>:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">In computing a Great Age, the Markandeya Purana invokes the factor &#x2019;71 and a fraction thereof.&#x2019; This is an interesting clue. In fact, because of precession, the vernal equinox moves along the ecliptic by one degree in a little over seventy-one years. When we take this into account and remember that &#x015A;iva causes a total solar eclipse in the lunar asterism P&#x00FA;shya, or Delta Cancri, at the end of the Great Age (as, in fact, is specifically mentioned, for example, in the Mah&#x0101;bh&#x0101;rata, V&#x00E1;na Parva), it is easy to see that after about 4,320,000 years a total solar eclipse recurs in the same lunar asterism when the Sun is at a fixed point in the ecliptic, say, the vernal equinox. This follows from the fact that 432,000 years are almost exactly divisible by the eclipse cycle of 6585.32 days (18 years and 11.33 days, the saros). Secondly, the period of 4,320,000 years is divisible by the precessional cycle of 25,867 years, corresponding to a precession of 50.1 arc seconds per year, a value close to today&#x2019;s accepted value of 50.26 arc seconds per year. It is interesting that this concept of &#x015A;iva shooting his arrow from the constellation of P&#x00FA;shya originates in the earliest piece of Hindu &#x2013; indeed Indo-European &#x2013; literature, namely the &#x0156;g Veda itself.</p>
<p class="quotei">There is also an interesting numerical twist here: 86,400,000 equals the product of 1<sup>1</sup> &#x00D7; 2<sup>2</sup> &#x00D7; 3<sup>3</sup> &#x00D7; 4<sup>4</sup> &#x00D7; 5<sup>5</sup>! This kind of relationship is typical of the poetic and esoteric nature of ancient Hindu astronomy.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">Astronomers make their own fun, eh? But the good doctor brings up an excellent point: the composers of the Rig Veda had a hugely sophisticated mathematical component to their star lore &#x2013; at a date that straddles the end of the Ice Age &#x2013; that suggests to those in the know that the movements of the macrocosm are reflected in the movements of the microcosm, that there is a fractal component to this sky/ground dualism. Additionally, it encodes some alarmingly precise measurements for cosmic phenomena that took mankind literal millennia to prove correct.</p>
<p class="indent">Ring any bells?</p>
<p class="h4"><b>Harappan Structures</b></p>
<p class="indent">Armed with an awareness of the sophisticated astronomy evident in the earliest of the Vedic texts, any number of Harappan rituals and structures begin to actually make
<a id="page_145"></a>
sense. This is yet further evidence for their contemporaneity, especially when their complexity moves along a spectrum from &#x2018;present, but nascent&#x2019; &#x2013; as found in the Rig Veda &#x2013; to &#x2018;full blown sky/ground dualism&#x2019; as evidenced in the Yajur Veda. And so we return to the humble burnt brick.</p>
<p class="indent">Returning to the &#x2018;no bricks in the Rig Veda&#x2019; and &#x2018;many bricks in the Yajur Veda,&#x2019; it is highly illustrative that, in the context of listing the various nakshatras, we find specific instructions on how to construct Vedic fire altars. 10,800 baked bricks are required, which is 360 (days in a year) x 30 (days in a month), over five levels. Most commonly, these fire altars are representations of the creator god, Prajapati, who also represents the entire year. Thus we have the construction of a calendrical, microcosmic cosmos. It was, of course, the Harappans who built towns with populations numbering in the tens of thousands out of millions and millions of baked bricks.</p>
<p class="indent">Other Indus seals depict seven priests tending a fire altar. The site of Kalibangan, home of the mother goddess seal, has seven fire altars. Given the role of the Pleiades and their association with Agni/Prajapati/the beginning of the year, it is difficult to draw any conclusion other than the suggestion that Harappa and the Vedas are intimately related, especially as the Pleiades rose on the vernal equinox during the Harappan era.</p>
<p class="indent">It seems likely that the Harappans made use of gnomons or &#x2018;sun sticks&#x2019;; Once you have ensured a completely flat base, a stick perpendicular to the horizon can be used to determine solstices and equinoxes based on taking shadow measurements at midday. About a dozen &#x2018;pedestals&#x2019; have been found at Mohenjo Daro whose use is currently unknown. They look like solid, inverted bowls with a carefully flattened base and an indentation in the top which could have held a wooden gnomon (or possibly a lingam). Adding credence to the gnomon interpretation is they are decorated with the trefoil pattern known to be associated with stars on the royal robes of Mesopotamia. The Vedas and their subsequent commentaries record multiple instructions for the building of gnomons.</p>
<p class="indent">Also worth noting is that several Harappan towns, including Rahman Dheri (3,000 <small>BCE</small>), were oriented to the cardinal directions. Streets and buildings in Mohenjo Daro diverge two degrees from the cardinal points which, as Parpola notes, would align perfectly with the setting of Aldebaran behind the Kirthar mountains in the west. Aldebaran is in between the Pleiades and Orion. It is a star in Taurus, the bull. At Mohenjo Daro&#x2019;s latitude, Aldebaran is also close enough to the ecliptic to be regularly occulted by the Moon, such as at times around the autumnal equinox.</p>
<a id="page_146"></a>
<p class="h4"><b>Kingly Ritual</b></p>
<p class="indent">Just as in Polynesia and Sumeria and Egypt, the ritual actions of the king were crucial in aligning the heavenly and terrestrial realms. He was the cuckoo in the imperial clock, setting the royal calendar at regular intervals.</p>
<p class="indent">This notion of kingship <i>descending</i> from the stars, and the king <i>going up</i> to the stars to ensure immortality and the wellbeing of the tribe is highly likely to be the origin of the hermetic and Classical ritual magic we find in the grimoires, having come down to us via the dual routes of the Nile and the Fertile Crescent. If this stellar technology reaches back to the first emergence of the Laurasian storyline, as I believe it does, then we may, with a straight face, say western ritual magic is at least 30,000 years old. We may also, with a smiling face, send the Ancient Aliens crowd back to the library to check their numbers.</p>
<p class="indent">The earliest Vedas regularly mention the four or sometimes five directions of space. Returning to Asko Parpola&#x2019;s &#x2018;Beginnings of Indian Astronomy&#x2019;:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">One ritual connected with the directions of space is crucially important for understanding their ideological significance. This is the &#x2018;mounting of the regions&#x2019; (<i>digvy&#x0101;sth&#x0101;panam</i>), which is an essential part of the Vedic royal consecration. In this rite &#x2013; also called Varu&#x0146;a-sava as it is connected with the God Varuna, the &#x2018;divine king&#x2019; &#x2013; the king at his consecration dons the <i>t&#x0101;rpya</i> garment ornamented with applicated figures of <i>dhi&#x015F;&#x0146;yas</i>, i.e. ritual fireplaces equated with the stars &#x2026; This royal robe of Varuna almost certainly goes back to the trefoil-ornamented &#x2018;sky garment&#x2019; of the Harappan &#x2018;priest-king&#x2019; modelled on Mesopotamian prototypes. Then the king makes a step in each of the five directions, therewith ascending the zenith: &#x2018;from the quarters he goes to the heaven&#x2019;&#x2026; ; for &#x2018;heaven is the quarters of space (<i>di&#x015B;o vai svargo lokah</i>).&#x2019; The &#x015A;atapatha-Br&#x0101;hma&#x0146;a (5,4,1,8) explains: &#x2018;It is the seasons, the year, that he [the <i>adhvaryu</i> priest] thereby makes him [the king] ascend; and having ascended the seasons, the year, he is high, high above everything here.&#x2019;</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">In the explicit use of directionality, we clearly see the shamanic origins of a ritual designed to both appropriate and set right the entire universe. Viewed with the eyes of an occultist rather than an academic, we can spy the exact same ritual form present in Old Kingdom Egypt and Sumeria; so we now require an origin date for this &#x2018;astronomical immortality tech&#x2019; old enough to have influenced the very beginnings of all three cultures. We also require a location for this tech that reconciles with its presence in the Pacific and South America.</p>
<a id="page_147"></a>
<p class="h3"><b>HOW MUCH HARAPPA?</b></p>
<p class="indent">There are few places where academia has so boxed itself into a corner as with the Indus Valley cultures. We are presented with an entire civilisation whose written language we cannot decipher ending just before a mysterious cultural group &#x2013; without a homeland or genetic footprint &#x2013; shows up with an apparently rapidly-assembled cosmology that not only describes the end of the Ice Age in Northwest India but is an exact match for many of the ritual items and structures found in Harappan cities.</p>
<p class="indent">Realigning the cosmology of the Vedas with the development of the Harappan civilisation paints a more complete picture: we see Laurasian pastoralists survive a climate event and then immediately develop in cultural and spiritual complexity; trading with, influencing and being influenced by their neighbours in all directions; all of whom underwent a simultaneous technological leap at this time that is so impressive we might cheekily refer to it as the first space race, given its intimate association with stellar ritual magic.</p>
<p class="indent">Refuseniks to the Ice Age/Harappa/Vedas realignment are, by definition, navigating with a dramatically incomplete map. At its height, it is estimated that the Indus Valley alone was home to a million people. The recently discovered Harappan city of Rakhigari is estimated to stretch over more than 224 hectares, of which only the tiniest minority have been excavated. The story of Harappa is not even close to being told in any complete fashion, and to confidently declare its total separation from the Eurasian oral cosmology known as the Vedas is foolishness in the extreme. Let no one tell you otherwise.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>SUMERIA</b></p>
<p class="indent">There is no question that the Sumerians, and specifically their origin, are downright weird. None other than Carl Sagan himself said that if any ancient culture had had contact with extraterrestrials, it would have been the Sumerians.</p>
<p class="indent">Around 3,500 <small>BCE</small> they appear fully formed in the archaeological record, speaking a language entirely unrelated to those around it, building great cities and ziggurats, irrigating the desert and writing, writing, writing as if the entire civilisation had some form of OCD dementia.</p>
<p class="indent">Mainstream academia&#x2019;s refusal to close the Sumerian story&#x2019;s gaping holes has unfortunately led to a lot of people parking their flying saucers in them. In the otherwise excellent <i>The Ark Before Noah: Decoding the Story of The Flood</i>, Dr Irving Finkel moves straight from acknowledging we have no idea where Sumerian language came from to describing the language itself and how the reader may interpret Sumerian texts. We should expect better.</p>
<a id="page_148"></a>
<p class="indent">Returning to the evening of Dr Finkel&#x2019;s book launch, I asked him about the fact that the earliest version of the Flood myth, based on his own translation, has animals put into the ark that are all predomesticated, that is <i>wild</i> animals, from a time before farming. My question was whether he thought that meant the entire Flood myth had its origins in a cultural memory of the end of the Ice Age, i.e. a time prior to animal domestication. He described my question as &#x2018;huge&#x2019; and probably warranted a whole separate conference to &#x2018;really thrash that out.&#x2019; This is academic speak for &#x2018;yes, obviously, but I don&#x2019;t want to be the one to say it. (In his defence, I probably wouldn&#x2019;t risk a dream job at the British Museum, either.) In what has become the definitive undergraduate textbook on the subject, <i>A History of the Ancient Near East</i>, Marc Van De Mieroop writes:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">The rapid increase in settled populations at that time cannot be explained with certainty. It seems too fast to have been the result of indigenous population growth alone, even if new agricultural conditions promoted demographic expansion. There may have been an increased sedentarization of semi-nomadic people previously unrecognizable in the archaeological record, or outsiders may have entered the region because of climatic changes or other reasons.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">Thus we can place the blame for the rapid growth in &#x2018;Annunaki bloodline&#x2019; jibber jabber at the feet of academic timidity and groupthink, rather than at the feet of Sitchin and Von Daniken. The first step is, inevitably, admitting we have a problem. Like Harappa, we are operating off a tiny dataset compared to what is actually available. Only a minority of Sumerian tablets in public hands have ever been translated. Notorious financial forecaster and analyst Martin Armstrong, a former private collector of Sumerian tablets, estimates that the tablets in public hands are themselves a minority of the total excavated number, with a significant majority furnishing private collections around the world. The modern black market for Sumerian antiquities is now entering its second century.</p>
<p class="indent">It is not just tablets. We are also missing entire cities. Recently released images from Cold War satellites show dozens and dozens of cities and large towns that have clearly never been excavated. All of this before we even get to the fact that Sumeria appeared beside the high water mark of the end of the Ice Age, <i>at</i> the end of the Ice Age, with a worldwide Flood and stories of civilising sages as cornerstones of their cosmology. The gun could not possibly be emitting more smoke!</p>
<p class="indent">By now, the story of Mesopotamia&#x2019;s influence on western esotericism is a fairly well told one, so we will not dwell on it here. The goal of this book is to push the timelines
<a id="page_149"></a>
back beyond it quite significantly and also demonstrate other, underappreciated vectors of influence in general. What we need to do here is demonstrate the earlier origins of and influences on the Sumerians to bring them into alignment with the geology, genetics and astrotheology of contemporaneous cultures, because it very likely says something profound about the journey of the Laurasian storyline in general and magic in particular.</p>
<p class="indent">This also serves to permanently banish the aliens back into the sky, and frees up modern esotericists to look anew at Sumerian star lore and what it might mean for contemporary practice. Much like Dynastic Egypt, the holes in Sumeria are all bunched up at the beginning. Once the culture actually gets started, the flying saucers have a tendency to vanish on their own and Bronze Age civilisation continues on its merry way. So like the Flandrian Transgression bringing the ocean up to the gates of Eridu, we bring our story to the door but we do not enter.</p>
<p class="h4"><b>Sumerian Morphology</b></p>
<p class="indent">The reason for contemporary squeamishness about cranial and skeletal studies is not because the data are unsound, it is what the data have historically been used for. Late nineteenth century examinations of the cranial capacity of sub-Saharan Africans was used to demonstrate they were &#x2018;less intelligent&#x2019; than Caucasians, for instance. This is obviously the most preposterous pseudoscientific conclusion but the actual data &#x2013; that skull shapes differ between racial groups &#x2013; are sound. A good example of using these data correctly would be the field of forensics, where human remains are gradually identified based on their morphology.</p>
<p class="indent">There is perhaps a secondary reason for modern historians to pretend these data do not exist. And that is because, in cases such as Sumeria and Egypt, we once again have hard scientific evidence that falls outside of their preferred story of what happened in the past. What came to be known as &#x2018;the Sumerian problem&#x2019; in the last century was the realisation gleaned from skeletal and cranial evidence that the Sumerian cities were multi-ethnic. The story of attempting to solve the Sumerian problem mirrors the story of increasing racial awareness inside archaeology over the last 130 years. It begins with invading superior races, the &#x2018;real Sumerians,&#x2019; dominating an indigenous Semitic tribe. The Sumerians came from Iran, the Sumerians came from the Caucasus, the Sumerians came from wherever.</p>
<p class="indent">At its core was the early twentieth century belief that race and civilisation were interrelated, probably the source of diffusionism&#x2019;s unpopularity today. As the realisation grew that race and civilisation were arbitrarily connected &#x2013; and that both terms probably do not have much underlying reality, anyway &#x2013; &#x2018;the Sumerian problem&#x2019;
<a id="page_150"></a>
stopped being a topic of discussion. &#x2018;New Archaeology&#x2019; arose in conjunction with postmodernism, that described culture as exclusively the interaction of a population with its local environment.</p>
<p class="indent">Nevertheless there are still all those skulls and bones languishing in London&#x2019;s Natural History Museum and the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. A 1930s analysis of skulls from Kish revealed a small minority of Austric skulls, a smaller minority of Armenoid skulls and a large majority of skulls described as &#x2018;Eurafrican.&#x2019; Somewhere near the centre of the Sumerian problem was the early twentieth century realisation that most of the Sumerian depictions were round-headed and most of the skulls uncovered were long-headed; only a minority matched the skulls as depicted, so &#x2018;clearly&#x2019; these must have been an invading elite.</p>
<p class="indent">It has been almost a hundred years since these interpretations were taken seriously. Other options have emerged. Given that &#x2018;Eurafrican&#x2019; skulls have the same features as Australoid &#x2013; that is southern India/New Guinean/Australian &#x2013; some have posited an influence from the Dravidian regions up into Sumeria at an early date. Others have countered by saying it is not that unusual for Africans to have been living in Kish or Eridu given their locations, which is certainly true, but the same can be said of India (which is my preferred interpretation of the skulls). In any case, there are multiple genetic links between East Africa and Dravidian India at an early date so I am not sure how useful the distinction really is. It appears that since probably before the end of the Ice Age these cultures were sailing up and down the coast and catching the Monsoon to and from the Horn of Africa.</p>
<p class="indent">That complexity is sort of the point. In the oldest extant Sumerian city, Eridu, cultural continuity in temple design and use has been demonstrated from the Ubaid period up into the Sumerian period. Looking at the change from the Ubaid period to the Uruk period, the archaeologist Henri Frankfort noted that the people associated with this cultural change were brachycephalic, a skull shape commonly associated with people from the east.</p>

<p class="h4"><b>Eridu</b></p>
<p class="indent">Eridu is the oldest Sumerian city (above sea level). Given it exhibits continuity from the Ubaid period up, that means it dates to around 5,000 <small>BCE</small> at the latest. (Interestingly, this is the same time as Mehrgarh Period II, about when we see fired bricks and probably the increased astronomical complexity of the Yagur Veda.)</p>

<p class="indent">There certainly appears to be more continuity between the various periods, particularly at Eridu, than a neat little table may immediately imply. Crucially when tracking magical vectors or survival, these continuities appear to be cultural rather than technological. If Dr Oppenheimer is correct, which seems likely, that the earliest layers of the Ubaid period are at the bottom of the Arabian Gulf, then he suggests the civilising component of the story of Ea &#x2013; a very Austronesian-sounding name &#x2013; may well reflect an historical episode: Ea brought the seven amphibian sages from the East to teach mankind the skills of civilisation. Ubaid pottery continued in the same location, Eridu, as the later, and cruder, Uruk pottery style. From an archaeological perspective, this is further evidence for cultures with different levels of technological complexity occupying the same space.</p>
<p class="indent">It seems significant that temples, which were larger to begin with, became smaller than palaces or kings&#x2019; residences over the course of Sumerian civilisation. Dr Oppenheimer suggests this could indicate the initial pre-eminence of a new priesthood &#x2013; and I would say an astronomical priesthood &#x2013; gradually declining as power centralised around the king. If this is indeed the case it may have coincided with the gradual rise to pre-eminence of the planets and the sun over the lunar/stellar calendar.</p>

<p class="h4"><b>Repositioning the Flood</b></p>
<p class="indent">You will recall that the ancient Near East flooded at the end of the Ice Age in three distinct phases.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> 9,000 <small>BCE</small>: First, there was the flooding of what is now the Arabian Gulf but would have been a presumably quite lovely river valley at the time. (Great place to live!)</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> 5,500 <small>BCE</small>: Further flooding of the gulf that brought the Tigris and Euphrates river mouths to approximately where they are today.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> 3,500 <small>BCE</small>: The Flandrian Transgression, that took the coastline a further 180 kilometres inland, very close to Eridu. The sea level gradually subsided to its present level over the next one and a half thousand years.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">If you cast your eyes back up to that table of Sumerian periods, you will quickly see some highly suspicious alignments. Realising there were three distinct inundations also provides a neat solve for some of the absurdities associated with the earliest dynasties of Kish, Ur and Erech. The King Lists unambiguously state that &#x2018;the flood&#x2019; happened before the first dynasties of these three cities. This is commonly assumed to be the Flandrian Transgression, but that only gives a few hundred years for the Early Dynastic Period to begin. The &#x2018;solve&#x2019; for this, such as it is, is to state that Kish, Ur and Erech&#x2019;s dynasties ran concurrently <i>&#x00E0; propos</i> of any evidence pointing in this direction.</p>
<p class="indent">Of course, if &#x2018;the flood&#x2019; refers to the 5,500 <small>BCE</small> inundation of the Arabian Gulf, then we have a lot more runway in which to allow these dynasties to take off. We also have an opportunity to look at the eight kings who reigned &#x2018;before the flood.&#x2019;</p>
<p class="indent">On that last note, the king lists begin with kingship itself descending from heaven, just as it does in Polynesia and the Vedas. The extremely long reigns of these first kings &#x2013; widely misinterpreted as proof of their alien status &#x2013; are in the very literal sense astronomical numbers.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The first king, Alulim, ruled for 28,800 years. This divides precisely into 4,320,000 150 times, or three times into 86,400.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The next king, Alalngar, ruled for 36,000 years, which is half a precessional cycle of 72,000. (And 1/120th of 4,320,000.)</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> En-men-lu-ana actually ruled for the Vedic number of 43,200 years.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> En-men-gal-ana was another 28,800 reign.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Dumuzid, the Shepherd, ruled for 36,000 years. Incidentally, if &#x2018;the Shepherd&#x2019; isn&#x2019;t Orion, I will eat my hat.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> En-sipad-zid-ana also had a 28,800 reign.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<a id="page_153"></a>
<p class="indent">Interestingly, the remaining two kings&#x2019; shorter reigns (of 21,000 years for En-mendur-ana and Ubara- Tutu&#x2019;s brisk 18,600 years) cease dividing conveniently into the cosmic Vedic number and become divisible by 12, which is a more human/earth centric number; the twelve constellations.</p>
<p class="indent">The supposedly &#x2018;human&#x2019; first kings of the First Dynasty of Kish which follows on from these large numbers, after the Flood, are also divisible by 12. &#x2018;After the flood had swept over, and the kingship had descended from heaven, the kingship was in Kish.&#x2019; Jushur ruled for 1200 years, Kullassina-bel for 960 years, and so on. Not all of the First Dynasty kings are neatly divisible by 12, but a majority of them are, which indicates the same progression down from a calendrical, cosmic &#x2018;Golden Age&#x2019; &#x2013; as expected for a Laurasian mythology. Very large &#x2018;stellar&#x2019; numbers scale down to &#x2018;smaller&#x2019; planetary and astrological numbers. These planetary or &#x2018;earth centric&#x2019; numbers scale down again to reigns more in keeping with human lifespans. As the &#x2018;Golden Age&#x2019; became &#x2018;our&#x2019; age, so kingship scaled down from the stars to humans.</p>
<p class="indent">Same calendrical system, same source of kingship, same time period. Sitchin&#x2019;s Annunaki did not come from the stars, they are the stars.</p>
<p class="h4"><b>Seven Sages</b></p>
<p class="indent">You may have guessed that I suspect the &#x2018;seven amphibious sages who came from the East&#x2019; are the Pleiades. But it is a common pitfall of astrotheological research to assume that just because an event or person can be matched to one asterism or another then that event did not happen or that person did not exist. We need to adopt the more mythic thinking of our ancestors: any purported civilising refugees coming from the direction of the rising of the Pleiades would be associated with that asterism. It is a &#x2018;both&#x2019; form of thinking, rather than an &#x2018;either/or.&#x2019; In fact it may be that if their arrival had coincided with the heliacal rising of the Pleiades then they might have received a better reception and it was this fortunate timing that led to their civilising efforts being so successful.</p>
<p class="indent">For whatever it is worth, many scholars of Mesopotamia are surprisingly open to the idea this was an actual event, presumably without fully thinking through the implications of it: if the sages were real, where did they come from? Stephanie Dalley, in her <i>Myths from Mesopotamia: Creation, The Flood, Gilgamesh and Others</i>, notes that the god Ea, whose first temple resided in Eridu, was &#x2018;credited with bringing in the seven amphibian sages from the East to teach crafts to man.&#x2019;</p>
<a id="page_154"></a>
<p class="h3"><b>SUMMING UP</b></p>
<p class="indent">Reexamination of the similarities between our earliest cultures in light of the presumed cosmology of Sundaland paints a very compelling story of the period between 20,000 <small>BCE</small>, through the end of the Ice Age and up to the appearance of Harappan and Sumerian civilisation.</p>
<p class="indent">The case against extending this timeline is flimsy, particularly when the hard genetic and geological data are factored in: three cultures with hugely overlapping mythemes separated in time and space by thousands of years and entire oceans coming up with the same names, calendars and spiritual concepts. These include:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The prominence of the Pleiades, Taurus and Orion.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> A Lunar calendar that predates a solar one.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Precision alignment of buildings to particular asterisms, or the creation of &#x2018;maps of the sky&#x2019; here on earth.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Kingship descending from the stars and the ritual requirement of the king to return to them to secure his own immortality and safeguard the life of the tribe/city.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The simultaneous appearance of this magical technology, along with other technologies such as irrigation-based agriculture (such as you find in the ancient rice paddies of Southeast Asia).</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">There is also sufficient overlap in the magic and ritual structures of South America (and China to some considerable extent) to make the case that we can precisely locate the influencing ancestor culture at the last point on earth where these three cultures had the opportunity to diverge.</p>
<p class="indent">What you are looking at here might be called Proto-Hermeticism: a magical technology that involves mirroring the sky on the ground for the purposes of achieving union with the universe/immortality. We are thus presented with the amusing situation of proving accidentally correct all those Renaissance magicians who saw the wisdom of Hermes Trismegistus as coming down to mankind from a time before the Flood. In a way, it did.</p>
<p class="indent">If you believe that the appearance of the same beliefs, calendars, rituals and names/functions for the stars can emerge simultaneously &#x2013; immediately following an extreme climate event that would have scattered much of the world&#x2019;s population &#x2013; in an unrelated or coincidental manner then I have a large, pointy tomb beside a river to sell you. Only one previous owner.</p>
<p class="indent">Perhaps less.</p>
