<p class="indent" style="margin-top:2em;">It is the evening of August 28th, 1859. The night sky over London fills with incandescent, swirling light. Too far south, too bright and the wrong time of year to be the Northern Lights, these displays are curiously humanoid, witnesses describe the display as looking like couples performing a waltz.</p>
<p class="indent">About forty hours earlier, an enormous coronal mass ejection (CME), accompanied by a solar proton event, erupted from the sun and tore through space in our direction. (Synchronicitists take note that it took seventeen hours to arrive.) When it reached the earth, this CME, in the form of a spiralling double helix, collapsed the magnetosphere, pushing our &#x2018;magnetic shielding&#x2019; down to just seven thousand kilometres from its usual sixty five thousand. As the outpouring of plasma swirled around and past our planet, its magnetic field pivoted so that it was opposite the Earth&#x2019;s field, releasing enormous amounts of energy. It was this energy that generated the brilliant light show witnessed by Victorian Londoners.</p>
<a id="page_110"></a>
<p class="indent">This is known today as the Carrington Event and whilst it is the largest such CME of the previous few centuries, it is comparatively minor when viewed over a longer timeline of the last few hundred thousand years. The damage was limited mostly to the telegraph system of the day, which was a mere two hundred thousand kilometres of cabling. Some telegraph operators found that they could operate their equipment even when it was unplugged from its battery, other stations reported strange and garbled messages, yet more witnessed sparks flying from their machines. As a disquieting aside, a Carrington level event reaching the Earth today, for which we are overdue, would fry the nerve system of the entire planet. Replacing it would take over a year. The death toll would climb into the millions, higher in the developed world than the developing, as everything from modern farming techniques, food transportation and emergency services rely entirely on modern communication.</p>
<p class="indent">Researchers such as Paul LaViolette have noticed the startling similarity between descriptions of the Carrington Event and humanoid petroglyphs from the Neolithic. There is much to recommend the suggestion that aberrant space weather is recorded in some of the world&#x2019;s earliest art and mythology. Even NASA has noted that some of the depictions on the ceiling of the Rouffignac Cave in France probably represent auroras.</p>
<p class="indent">Given what we know about the antiquity of certain mythemes &#x2013; many of which are significantly older than the end of the Ice Age &#x2013; the question then becomes how we separate out the &#x2018;real&#x2019; from the &#x2018;mythological&#x2019; when examining a climate event that was positively biblical.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>VAN DIEMEN&#x2019;S LAND</b></p>
<p class="indent">A few decades before the Carrington Event and on the other side of the world, George Augustus Robinson is committing that sort of helpful genocide in which the empire specialised. It is 1831 and he is on the east coast of Tasmania, rounding up the few remaining Aborigines who have not fallen to disease or the settlers&#x2019; guns so that they can be resettled into reservations on some islands in the Bass Strait.</p>
<p class="indent">The helpful Mr Robinson hears a story from the indigenous people. They tell him that Van Diemen&#x2019;s Land (Tasmania) was once connected to New Holland (the Australian mainland). Their ancestors had walked over and then the sea level had risen to where it is today. In Europe at the time, the closest thing the Academy had to an Ice Age theory was an explanation for the dispersal of rocks in the Alps that may have had something to do with glaciation. There was some speculation that perhaps the polar ice caps had extended further down to the bottom of the temperate zones. Regardless, these were certainly not the circles that George Robinson moved in. Originally
<a id="page_111"></a>
from London, he had first attempted to seek his fortune in Nicaragua, however the colony he had selected turned out to be a fraudulent enterprise. (This was not uncommon.) Tasmania was his second choice of location in which to strike it rich, and he left a wife and five children behind in order to do so. Greedy and drearily religious, he was not the type to commence a speculative geological investigation under his own initiative, although his diaries certainly suggest he believed himself capable of doing so.</p>
<p class="indent">To his credit, Robinson went this far: &#x2018;For aught we know V.D.L. (Van Diemen&#x2019;s Land) might at an early period have been joined to N.H. (New Holland) in which case the tradition would be true.&#x2019; Almost two centuries later, we know the tradition is indeed true. Tasmania became an island fourteen thousand years ago, tens of millennia after the first Aborigines arrived there, cut off from the mainland by 200 kilometres of unpredictable and extremely dangerous seas. If you are looking for evidence that the oral traditions of hunter gatherer societies can convey accurate historical information then this is it. The native Tasmanians&#x2019; understanding of the geology of their homeland was significantly more advanced than that of their technologically superior neighbours. George Robinson&#x2019;s story is a very compelling proof of concept.</p>
<p class="indent">Recent research into Indigenous Australian folklore has found additional accounts of the end of the Ice Age among tribes near modern day Melbourne, Kangaroo Island, Rottnest Island, Fitzroy Island and the Tiwi Islands. Quoted in <i>Scientific American</i>, the University of New England&#x2019;s Nicholas Reid said, &#x2018;There are aspects of storytelling in Australia that involved kin-based responsibilities to tell the stories accurately. Cross-generational scaffolding can keep a story true.&#x2019;</p>
<p class="h3"><b>THE FLOOD</b></p>
<p class="indent">The modern world&#x2019;s chronological understanding of time aligns poorly with how cultures previously viewed past events, which was largely either place-based or part of a wider mythology of group identity.</p>
<p class="indent">This has led many an historian astray when he or she goes off looking for the &#x2018;real&#x2019; Noah&#x2019;s Ark or some such thing. The error in this case is applying a modern literalism to the location and dating of that particular iteration of the story which can only ever be culture and location-specific. Consider the changing fashion styles of Jesus and Mary as they move across Europe over the centuries, getting whiter and whiter until Mary ends up with the flowing red hair of the Celts, dressed as a member of the French court. You are bound to be disappointed if you take this as your map and go looking for first century Christians in North Wales, but this is what seekers after Noah&#x2019;s Ark are doing.</p>
<a id="page_112"></a>
<p class="indent">Combining an understanding of geology with an awareness that mythology&#x2019;s primary purpose is cultural expression rather than scientific depiction, we can nevertheless construct, if not a map, then at least a key with which to interpret various maps.</p>
<p class="indent">More than any other tableau, the Flood requires the most rigorous distributional analysis. There is a veritable deluge of flimsy pseudopsychological &#x2018;explanations&#x2019; for the prevalence of Flood myths around the planet, or in Witzel&#x2019;s case, outright dismissal because of a personal preference that in <i>this</i> particular case, mythology should not be capable of transmitting actual events. Other evidence-free suggestions range from metaphors for amniotic fluid and the birth process to the notion that the Flood represents the collective unconscious or the dream state. Again, such explanations require the stories to be randomly distributed, and they most certainly are not. The next most common dismissal, as mentioned in a preceding chapter, is that stories of global cataclysms are sometimes written off as a confused exaggeration of local weather events by unsophisticated tribespeople. The research into the stories of the First Australians does not bear this out.</p>
<p class="indent">With respect to the magical tradition and what may represent Palaeolithic survivals, the presence of non-randomly distributed flood stories &#x2013; and who or what managed to survive them &#x2013; offers us the opportunity for some careful calibration. Because in the western tradition, the story of the Flood is intimately tied up, for better or for worse, with the notion of &#x2018;lost wisdom.&#x2019; None of this suggests that parts of the world that were impacted less by the end of the Ice Age fail to demonstrate Palaeolithic continuity, just that they may lack a definitive &#x2018;mythic calibrator&#x2019; to determine what happened before the end of the Ice Age and what happened afterward. Africa is the best example of this. It is the continent that suffered the least amount of land loss at the end of the Ice Age and has probably the lowest number of indigenous flood myths relative to the number of local cultures. However, prior to the expansion of the Muslim and then northern European empires, African cultures, particularly in the south, were comparatively unmolested for hundreds of thousands of years. It seems very likely that many of the beliefs found here are Palaeolithic survivals. With fewer intervening &#x2018;calibrating cataclysms,&#x2019; we have fewer opportunities to time stamp these myths.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>THE END OF THE ICE AGE</b></p>
<p class="indent">Transitioning out of the Pleistocene was not a single event. Beginning around 12,000 <small>BCE</small>, the climate started to warm and much of the water locked up in glacial ice began to melt. There followed a short cold spell known as the Younger Dryas, then the planet rapidly warmed again and we moved out of the &#x2018;official&#x2019; Ice Age. According
<a id="page_113"></a>
to Greenland ice core data interpreted at the University of Copenhagen, this final warming could have happened in as short a time as three years.</p>
<p class="indent">If we include the inundation of the Arabian Gulf that occurred around 6,000 <small>BCE</small>, however, we are looking at three separate and sudden sea level rises. These were anything but gradual. The change in the pressure exerted on our squishy planet as ice sheets melted or slipped off the land and into the ocean like ice cubes into a drink caused dramatic earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and superwaves of up to a mile high.</p>
<p class="indent">Taking just one location as an example, the meltwater flowing from the Canadian ice sheet into the Arctic around 12,000 <small>BCE</small> is estimated by the University of Alberta&#x2019;s Professor John Shaw at being 10 million cubic metres per second. This rate would drain Lake Ontario in less than four days. Staying in the same area, the Laurentide ice sheet spent centuries forming a giant lake as it gradually melted, which was protected from the ocean by an enormous ice barrier. Around 6,000 <small>BCE</small>, this barrier melted and the lake poured through the Hudson Strait and into the ocean. The volume of water added to the world&#x2019;s oceans from this event lifted the sea level by about 20&#x2013;40 centimetres instantly. In some parts of the world, once the resulting tsunamis were over, this event would have moved the shoreline dozens and dozens of kilometres inland.</p>
<p class="indent">The last two decades of geological research have yielded some very compelling insights as to what was happening with the planet&#x2019;s space weather while the sea levels were rising. Based on an analysis of Kilimanjaro ice cores, Dr Robert Schoch explains that during the period of 9,700 <small>BCE</small> to 6,000 <small>BCE</small> sunspot activity varied widely. It was initially extremely active, then plunged to levels of very low activity, then rose again. Although it is likely this solar activity had an impact on the dramatic climate events occurring on earth, the mechanism for how and by how much is not currently clear. We can be extremely confident, however, that whilst our ancestors were experiencing superwaves, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and dramatic changes to their food supply, the sky would also periodically light up with the sort of dancing figures that were witnessed over London during the Carrington Event. It would be stranger if ancient mythologies didn&#x2019;t include references to the most dramatic climate upheavals hominins have ever experienced than if they did.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>SUNDALAND</b></p>
<p class="indent">As for the impact of the end of the Ice Age in the corner of the world that provides us with the most compelling genetic and linguistic evidence for Pleistocene cultural complexity? It would have been extreme. The Sunda Shelf, as the name implies, is quite flat. According to Dr Oppenheimer, the maximum horizontal distance between 20 metre depth contours is almost 2,000 kilometres. When the sea came in, it went
<a id="page_114"></a>
far, fast. Every ten centimetre sea level rise would push the water a kilometre inland, meaning the initial flood would have gone four kilometres inland in under two days. Here Dr Oppenheimer tactfully understates the drama of this catastrophe in <i>Eden in the East</i>:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">We can imagine that the sea would not have come in quietly. Further fluctuations would have resulted from rebound of the Earth&#x2019;s crust relieved of a heavy load.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">The impact of these events on archaeological visibility is significant. Evidence of coastal or lowland settlement &#x2013; where the majority of mankind has always lived &#x2013; before 6,000 <small>BCE</small> is probably lost forever. In addition to this permanent horizon, there is a secondary one as the sea levels actually rose <i>above</i> their present levels with the final glacial melt and only settled back down in approximately 3,500 <small>BCE</small>. Hence the survivors of the first cataclysm who returned to the coast are under another silt level.</p>
<p class="indent">It is tremendously significant that the resettling of the sea back to its present level occurs at the same moment that twentieth century archaeologists considered the &#x2018;sudden beginnings of civilisation,&#x2019; particularly in the next two parts of the globe we shall examine as they both also suffered significant land loss. Indeed, it is that very period between 6,000 <small>BCE</small> and 3,500 <small>BCE</small> that is the most confusing when it comes to the study of civilisational emergence. The implications of the geology of the final sea level rise is that the rise of &#x2018;civilisation&#x2019; was anything but sudden and its antecedents should be sought under the silt. As for <i>their</i> antecedents, it is unlikely much of them will ever be found.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>INDIA</b></p>
<p class="indent">The postcolonial toxicity that afflicts Indian history is probably nowhere more evident than in its marine archaeology. It is evident that the coastline holds numerous underwater settlements, both around the northern part of Sri Lanka and off the western coast of the mainland, where the Indus and Saraswati would once have drained into the sea. The next largest amount of land lost to the ocean is off the coast of Bangladesh in the Bay of Bengal, which remains prone to flooding today. During the Boxing Day tsunami when the ocean receded by almost a mile, numerous submerged remains were exposed to the air for the first time in thousands of years.</p>
<p class="indent">Unfortunately, the political desire to declare India as the sole source of all subsequent civilisations has led to some overly ambitious interpretations of the marine evidence. There are certainly manmade objects under the water, sometimes miles off the coast of India and Sri Lanka, which by definition makes them antediluvian. However,
<a id="page_115"></a>
to immediately leap to the conclusion that these remains are Krishna&#x2019;s lost city of Dwarka or Kumari Kandam is to fall into the same trap as researchers looking for Noah&#x2019;s Ark or the &#x2018;real&#x2019; Garden of Eden. By the time these stories are being told they are separated by millennia from the geological events they may be describing. We are talking about fuzzy memories rather than precision ones.</p>
<p class="indent">Discernment is once again required in separating the archaeological facts from their interpretation. Because the facts are quite clear. At its height, the Indus culture had at least six cities of more than 30,000 residents, kiln-fired bricks requiring temperatures of up to 1,700 degrees, and it appears with a fully formed script at the same time as the final geological silt layer. Off the coast of this civilisation there are submerged, manmade objects. From a purely physical level it is irrelevant which of these objects are &#x2018;Dravidic&#x2019; and which of these objects are &#x2018;Harappan.&#x2019; How these objects and climate events may have been refracted through mythology is the topic of the next chapter.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>SUMERIA</b></p>
<p class="indent">The Ice Age experienced its final death rattle in the Arabian Gulf, right beside the mysterious culture we most closely associate, correctly or incorrectly, with the rise of civilisation. What role flooding has played in the story of the Sumerians, the people who gave the west the majority of our flood myths, has been a cause of considerable debate for more than a century.</p>
<p class="indent">Now known as the Flandrian Transgression, the sea level overshoot actually took the ocean about 180 kilometres inland from where the Tigris and Euphrates currently empty into the ocean. This transgression puts the shoreline right at the gate of the ancient city of Ur and within twenty five kilometres of the even older city of Eridu. It also made the settlements of the state of Lagash coastal. Just as is the case in Sundaland, we are presented with an initial flood more than ten thousand years ago that turned the idyllic Arabian valley into the Arabian Gulf, then a second marine incursion that moved the shoreline further up the two main rivers, then, several thousand years later, a final flood that initially moved the shore even further inland before pulling back almost a hundred kilometres to its present position.</p>
<p class="indent">Finding archaeological evidence above and below the resulting silt level has caused no small level of confusion. Returning to Dr Oppenheimer:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">It was as if a curtain of water had been drawn across the remains of previous coastal settlements. Pots and implements that allow archaeologists to define prehistoric cultures were inaccessible; they lay under silt and under the sea, miles from the
<a id="page_116"></a>
shoreline. But there was a window. Over the next few thousand years the sea level settled back by up to 5 metres, and the coastline emerged again, to a distance of over 100 kilometres. This partial drawing back of the curtain allowed Woolley to peer under the silt layer, at the few hundred years after the main force of the flood of Utnapishtim struck. Because marine inundation persisted from around 7500 to 5500 years ago on many of these sites, there was a big gap between the archaeological remains under the silt layer and those above it.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">The Woolley he is referring to is Sir Leonard Woolley, the British Assyriologist and archaeologist known for his excavations at Ur, a man that history has been kind, then unkind and now slightly kind to once again. During his examination of the city of Ur, he encountered the silt layer that we now know was laid down by the Flandrian Transgression and declared two mostly wrong things. Firstly, that this was evidence of the Old Testament Flood, which is wrong simply because the Flandrian Transgression postdates the earliest iteration of the Flood story that ultimately came to be included in the Bible.</p>
<p class="indent">Secondly, he declared that the silt was laid down by a marine flood, not a riverine flood. At the time, with Ur so far from the shoreline and being situated on a river, he was widely mocked for his assertion. He even managed to calculate the height of the ocean at the time as being about four metres above its present level. In this instance, we now know that Woolley was correct and his public detractors were wrong. Not only that, but his calculation of the sea level was admirably close to what geology has demonstrated. He simply lacked a mechanism to explain precisely what the ocean was doing there that did not rely on Scripture.</p>
<p class="indent">A revised geological understanding has failed to disseminate publicly into wider Assyriology (although I have personally had some frank private discussions on the subject with academics). Much of this may be down to the persistent stink of churchiness associated with using the &#x2018;F&#x2019; word. As such, &#x2018;Woolley&#x2019;s Flood&#x2019; is still considered to be riverine. The source of the confusion seems to be a lack of understanding that a marine incursion up a river delta would lay down estuarine silt rather than marine silt anyway. Just think about how water would move upriver and form a &#x2018;wall&#x2019; that would lead to the river depositing silt brought down from the mountains at the new shoreline.</p>
<p class="indent">Woolley was dismissed but he is the perfect example of &#x2018;the story&#x2019; coming down to us out of sequence, a concept we will return to again. There were actually several floods, the first and second of which would have left the earliest sites underneath today&#x2019;s shoreline. The last of which took the ocean right up to Ur and Eridu, flooding at
<a id="page_117"></a>
least one of them, in 3,500 <small>BCE</small>, exactly when Sumerian civilisation bursts fully formed onto the scene, and coinciding with the story of the seven fish sages arriving from the east with the skills of high civilisation. Incidentally, although it is deeply unfashionable now thanks to its origins in a very racist period of European exploration, evidence from the skulls of these first Sumerians demonstrates they were brachycephalic, suggesting an eastern origin.</p>
<p class="indent">The curious geography of Sumeria&#x2019;s earliest period fits with the notion of them as coastal seafarers. It also makes it a near certainty that Sumeria&#x2019;s &#x2018;sudden&#x2019; appearance in the archaeological record is illusory and that its earliest layers lie both under and across at least one ocean. In all likelihood, Eridu is not the oldest city, merely the oldest coastal city not destroyed by the invading sea. In other words, it may be the last old city to be built at the post-glacial highwater point. Looking at the evidence for Eridu&#x2019;s earliest layers, Dr Oppenheimer observes that the Ubaid people who fashioned the oldest pottery found at Eridu also appear to have given both Eridu and Ur their names.&#x2019; He suspects, probably correctly, that the Ubaid people built coastal settlements which are now on or under the seabed of the Arabian Gulf.&#x2019;</p>
<p class="indent">Once the sea had rolled back and in the subsequent 1,500 years, the Sumerian and Babylonian civilisations climbed up the rivers of the Tigris and Euphrates, taking with them the stories of the floods of Utnapishtim, Gilgamesh and eventually Noah.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>FIRE IN THE SKY</b></p>
<p class="indent">The cause or causes of Ice Ages are not even close to being fully understood. They certainly repeat, but they do so irregularly. This rules out some kind of solar &#x2018;superseason&#x2019; as a singular &#x2018;cause.&#x2019; And the volcanic explanation &#x2013; that ash blocks out the sun for years at a time &#x2013; would leave clearly discernable geological layers.</p>
<p class="indent">Currently, the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis, out of Harvard, is the frontrunning explanation for the snap cooling that preceded the end of the last Ice Age. Ice core data show a 100-fold increase in platinum concentrations 12,890 years ago, which align with oxygen isotope measurements indicating a sharp drop in temperature.</p>
<p class="indent">It is believed that a large meteor hit the North American ice sheet, which could have killed 75% of the continent&#x2019;s population, wiped out large mammals such as the mammoth and changed oceanic circulation. Such an event would certainly go a long way to explaining the extremely rapid melting of some of the ice sheet. Rock scoring found in Canada indicates large flows of liquid water rather than the movement of glaciers. A large, burning space rock may account for this.</p>
<p class="indent">More recently, however, David Meltzer of Southern Methodist University has re-examined the data from 29 American sites used to support the Impact Hypothesis
<a id="page_118"></a>
and the date ranges stretch a lot further on either side of the supposed meteor event. This makes it unlikely that the abrupt climate change was caused by a single event &#x2013; always the preferred explanation of the academic. Once again, the facts remain and the interpretation needs revising. And what the facts indicate is our ancestors lived through a few centuries of some fairly extreme space weather.</p>
<p class="indent">Around 9,500 <small>BCE</small>, the sun was extremely active, with a record number of sunspots. For the next 1,500 years, sunspot activity varied dramatically. Between 8,800 <small>BCE</small> and around 6,000 <small>BCE</small>, activity continued to fluctuate, only with diminishing highs. These fluctuations correlate, albeit imprecisely, with the climate changes associated with the Dryas periods. Clearly there is some correlation between solar activity, space debris and the end of the Ice Age.</p>
<p class="indent">It is possible that the absence of definitive evidence is itself a form of evidence. Emerging from the global interest in climate research accompanying our Anthropocene is a new appreciation for the impact of cosmic rays and solar activity in weather formation. Acidity spike data from the Cariaco Basin and dramatic increases in nitrate ion concentration in ice core data from several sites around the world point to some extreme coronal mass ejections around this time. Analysis of solar flare tracks on the glassy surface of the point suggest the same thing; that solar flare activity has varied by a factor of more than fifty between the end of the Ice Age and now.</p>
<p class="indent">Extreme space weather &#x2013; perhaps caused by physical and electromagnetic debris travelling through the solar system &#x2013; may even show up in more prosaic explanations. A large gravitational wave, which can currently only be detected indirectly, would trigger earthquakes and volcanoes on earth as it passed by and through the planet. Independent researcher Paul LaViolette points out that the day after the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, the earth was hit by a major gamma ray burst from a neutron star located 50,000 light years away. The energy released by the flare from this distant star was greater than all the energy given off by the sun in the last hundred thousand years.</p>
<p class="indent">Geologist Dr Robert Schoch, in <i>Forgotten Civilisation</i>, explains how the impact of such extreme events may have been experienced by our ancestors.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">LaViolette discusses some of the effects of a massive SPE and the attendant solar activity for the Earth. The ozone layer, our protection from deadly ultraviolet (UV) rays, would have been greatly depleted, with major ozone holes forming in some areas, that is, if the ozone layer had not been destroyed completely! Increased doses of damaging, and potentially lethal, UV radiation could have posed a major hazard for organisms on Earth, especially in high and middle latitudes. Besides the increased UV radiation, high-energy cosmic rays that are part of a major SPE would
<a id="page_119"></a>
penetrate the atmosphere and raise radiation levels on the ground. According to LaViolette&#x2019;s calculations, unprotected organisms at sea level during the event of &#x2018;12,837 cal yrs BP,&#x2019; which is the focus of his paper, could have accumulated radiation doses of 3 to 6 Sieverts (a unit of radiation exposure, 1 Sievert = 100 rems [an older unit of radiation doses]) over a period of two or three days. Lethal radiation doses for humans are in the range of about 3.5 Sieverts, and for many large mammals in the 3- to 8-Sievert range. The best mode of protection at the time, both from the UV radiation and the cosmic ray radiation, may have been to seek safety in caves and other underground shelters (<i>Space Daily</i> 2011; LaViolette 2005). Interestingly, Austrian archaeologist and speleologist Heinrich Kusch and his wife Ingrid Kusch have documented hundreds upon hundreds of tunnel systems under Neolithic settlements found throughout Europe and Turkey, some dating back to around twelve thousand years ago (Kusch and Kusch 2011). According to Heinrich Kusch, based on the number of tunnels that have survived to the present day, the original extent of such tunnels must have been absolutely enormous! According to him, many of the tunnels &#x2018;are not much larger than big wormholes &#x2013; just 70 cm wide &#x2013; just wide enough for a person to wriggle along but nothing else. They are interspersed with nooks, at some places it&#x2019;s larger and there is seating, or storage chambers and rooms. Taken together it is a massive underground network&#x2019; (Heinrich Kusch, quoted in <i>Austrian Times</i> 2011; see also <i>Daily Mail</i> 2011).</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">We are thus presented with the curious situation of having three sources of data &#x2013; mythological, archaeological and geological &#x2013; each on their own qualifying as circumstantial, but viewed collectively as something much more tantalising.</p>
<p class="indent">It is worth considering some of the Sumerian mythological descriptors, as they point to climate events beyond a &#x2018;mere&#x2019; change in sea level. In the Atrahasis telling of the Flood, not only are the pasturelands covered in white salt &#x2013; suggestive of a sea incursion &#x2013; but the resulting famine where families turn to eating their children is accompanied by scabs appearing on the skin and mouths.</p>
<p class="indent">Significantly, Atrahasis&#x2019;s boat must be protected from the sun, and is thus fully sealed over. Enki even gives him a sand clock that lasts seven days so that he knows when to come back out. The Flood, when it came, was accompanied by an extremely loud noise, darkening skies and a raging wind from Adad. Anzu tears at the sky with his talons, breaking it and letting the flood in. Consider this excerpt:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote"><i>The kasusu weapon went against the people like an army</i></p>
<p class="quote"><i>No one could see anyone else</i>,</p>
<a id="page_120"></a>
<p class="quote"><i>They could not be recognised in the catastrophe</i>.</p>
<p class="quote"><i>The Flood roared like a bull</i>,</p>
<p class="quote"><i>Like a wild ass screaming the winds howled</i></p>
<p class="quote"><i>The darkness was total, and there was no sun</i>.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">Not only do we have a description of a worldwide flood, but it also appears to have been accompanied by space weather so extreme that it has convinced more than a few people it is a description of the Sumerian space gods getting back in their ships and bombing the planet from orbit!</p>
<p class="indent">Given that the majority of the Earth&#x2019;s surface is covered by ocean, it is more likely than not that one or more large plasma events would have hit the sea. This would not show up anywhere in the geological record and would throw huge amounts of water up into the atmosphere, which would necessarily have to come back down in continuous heavy rainfall: forty days and forty nights of circumstantial evidence on a continuous feedback loop.</p>
<p class="indent">In his recent book, <i>The Ark Before Noah</i>, Dr Irving Finkel notes that all the animals on board the earliest version of the ark were predomesticated. They were part of a preagricultural culture&#x2019;s food supply. At his book launch in London, I had the occasion to ask him whether he thought that meant the Sumerian flood stories were a cultural memory of the end of the Ice Age, a time before agriculture. His eyes widened and he said that it was a huge issue that is probably worth us all thrashing out one day. Translating his response from the academic, that means <i>yes, but I am not going to be the first one to say it</i>.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>ATLANTIS</b></p>
<p class="indent">Inevitably, any discussion of the veracity of flood stories brings us back to the jewel in the western tradition&#x2019;s flood crown: Atlantis itself. It has already been noted by various researchers over the last twenty years that the dates Solon was given for the true age of Egyptian civilisation line up not only with the geological age of the Sphinx (8,000 years old in the sixth century <small>BCE</small>) but also with the end of the Ice Age, and thus the most significant flood event we have experienced in twenty millennia.</p>
<p class="indent">In light of the increasingly archaeological and geological visibility of the Palaeolithic and the Pleistocene, it is worth looking in more detail at what the priests actually had to say about world-ending catastrophes.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">And then one of the priests, a very old man, said, &#x2018;Ah, Solon, Solon, you Greeks are ever children. There isn&#x2019;t an old man among you.&#x2019; On hearing this, Solon said,
<a id="page_121"></a>
&#x2018;What? What do you mean?&#x2019; &#x2018;You are young,&#x2019; the old priest replied, &#x2018;young in soul, every one of you. Your souls are devoid of beliefs about antiquity handed down by ancient tradition. Your souls lack any learning made hoary by time. The reason for that is this: there have been, and there will continue to be, numerous disasters that have destroyed human life in many kinds of ways. The most serious of these involve fire and water, while the lesser ones have numerous other causes. And so also among your people the tale is told that Phaethon, child of the Sun, once harnessed his father&#x2019;s chariot, but was unable to drive it along his father&#x2019;s course. He ended up burning everything on the earth&#x2019;s surface and was destroyed himself when a lightning bolt struck him. This tale is told as a myth, but the truth behind it is that there is a deviation in the heavenly bodies that travel around the earth, which causes huge fires that destroy what is on the earth across vast stretches of time. When this happens all those people who live in mountains or in places that are high and dry are much more likely to perish than the ones who live next to rivers or by the sea. Our Nile, always our savior, is released and at such times, too, saves us from this disaster. On the other hand, whenever the gods send floods of water upon the earth to purge it, the herdsmen and shepherds in the mountains preserve their lives, while those who live in cities, in your region, are swept by the rivers into the sea. But here, in this place, water does not flow from on high onto our fields, either at such a time or any other. On the contrary, its nature is always to rise up from below. This, then, explains the fact that the antiquities preserved here are said to be the most ancient.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">Here we have further descriptions of extreme space weather in the form of chariots of the gods, repeated destructions of mankind (in keeping with a dramatic several millennia), the burning up of humans on the earth and destruction with a thunderbolt.</p>
<p class="indent">We also see different mortality rates for different settlements, depending on what kind of calamity is afflicting mankind. In fact, the chilling image of bodies being carried downriver into the sea is also found in the Sumerian flood myths, where the womb goddess accuses Enlil of cruelty for the genocide of his children: &#x2018;Would a true father have given rise to the rolling sea, so that [their bodies] could clog the river like dragon-flies?&#x2019; Returning to the Egyptian priest&#x2019;s words to Solon in <i>Timaeus</i>:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">The truth is that in all places where neither inordinate cold nor heat prevent it, the human race will continue to exist, sometimes in greater, sometimes in lesser numbers. Now of all the events reported to us, no matter where they&#x2019;ve occurred &#x2013; in your parts or in ours &#x2013; if there are any that are noble or great or distinguished in
<a id="page_122"></a>
some other way, they&#x2019;ve all been inscribed here in our temples and preserved from antiquity on.</p>
<p class="quotei">In your case, on the other hand, as in that of others, no sooner have you achieved literacy and all the other resources that cities require, than there again, after the usual number of years, comes the heavenly flood. It sweeps upon you like a plague, and leaves only your illiterate and uncultured people behind. You become infants all over again, as it were, completely unfamiliar with anything there was in ancient times, whether here or in your own region.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">Again, I find the alignments with human population and distribution estimates with the description of &#x2018;summer and winter&#x2019; highly suggestive. To me it speaks of parts of the earth opened and closed by ice and sea, as well as dramatic changes to grasslands that were quick enough to snap-freeze mammoth with their mouths still full of wild flowers.</p>
<p class="indent">As for what is preserved across cataclysms and <i>how</i>, we shall certainly return to that. You are invited to consider &#x2018;the heavenly flood &#x2026; like a plague&#x2019; in light of the radiational impact of a presumed solar particle event.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">And so, Solon, the account you just gave of your people&#x2019;s lineage is just like a nursery tale. First of all, you people remember only one flood, though in fact there had been a great many before. Second, you are unaware of the fact that the finest and best of all the races of humankind once lived in your region. This is the race from whom you yourself, your whole city, all that you and your countrymen have today, are sprung, thanks to the survival of a small portion of their stock. But this has escaped you, because for many generations the survivors passed on without leaving a written record.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">Again, this description of the origin of the Greeks is significant because it is exactly correct. The last twenty years of genetic research have revealed a migration from the Levant and Anatolia out into the Mediterranean around 8,000 <small>BCE</small>, followed by another two millennia of &#x2018;sloshing around&#x2019; from Greece to Malta to Menorca to Italy and back. It is likely these migrants were the &#x2018;Ur&#x2019; culture for the Greeks and Etruscans, as well as being the people who would subsequently introduce more &#x2018;Eastern&#x2019; ideas into the Celtic tribes.</p>
<p class="indent">The location and timing of this migration puts it exactly where and when the G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe culture was winding up. Thus it is both the origin of einkorn wheat agriculture, used by the Etruscans; and viticulture, used by everybody. (The presence of
<a id="page_123"></a>
an ecstatic god of meat-eating, drug-taking and wine who hails from a foreign hilltop and is associated with the mystery of agricultural renewal should be ringing a few bells about now.)</p>
<p class="indent">Inevitably, it seems, the Atlantologists have missed a trick. We have all been looking for the physical location of a political metaphor &#x2013; whose existence is the least interesting part of the story &#x2013; rather than calibrating the parts of the legend we can actually fix to some observable facts. Because what is so compelling about the Atlantis story is that it appears to be an example of Ice Age stories surviving all the way up to the sixth century <small>BCE</small> with a reasonable degree of accuracy. The implications for what else may have survived long enough to be able to impact the formulation of the western magical tradition are wide-reaching.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>THAT WHICH IS IMPERISHABLE</b></p>
<p class="indent">Out of the disasters associated with the end of the Ice Age came stories of giants, little people, angels and refugee wisdom teachers dedicated to rebuilding civilisation. The Flood is the pivotal event in the western mystery tradition, and I mean pivotal literally. Pinning it down finally provides us with a fixed location from which to view what came before and what came after.</p>
<p class="indent">The default &#x2018;alternative historical&#x2019; explanation for how the various sites around the world appear to encode astronomical and mathematical information is that they are in some sense a &#x2018;warning&#x2019; for future generations about what has happened and what will presumably happen again. These hypotheses strike me as quite weak. You will struggle to find instances in the historical record for times when mankind gave even the slightest shit about our children and grandchildren. Most of the time, we are either raping them ourselves or packing them off as sex slaves in politically expedient marriages to nearby warlords. Today we cannot even manage to keep the planet liveable for the next two generations.</p>
<p class="indent">It is a fundamental misreading of eschatology to assume we are concerned with the survival of humans rather than <i>wisdom</i>. Either given freely or torn from the hands of uncaring gods, it is the technology for immortality that must survive. That is a near-universal Laurasian refrain.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus it is more appropriate to consider these sacred sites as expressions of that which is imperishable, rather than the imperishable things themselves. In any case, it is frankly bad magic to think merely building a temple out of stone will enable it to survive cataclysms. You only need to spend an hour or so on YouTube looking at the impact of a recent tsunami on the world&#x2019;s most technologically advanced civilisation to see that it is a recipe for heartache. These &#x2018;expressions of the imperishable&#x2019;
<a id="page_124"></a>
would be what the Egyptian priest told Solon was the &#x2018;education&#x2019; that needed to be rediscovered. Consider this quote from historian Graham Robb&#x2019;s <i>The Ancient Paths: Discovering the Lost Map of Celtic Europe</i>.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">A historian of the Iron Age is often left with nothing but a question mark, like a shepherd clutching his crook when the sheep have run away. Does the microscopic artistry of Celtic smiths imply an equivalent expertise on a larger scale, or was the artist&#x2019;s forge a lonely light in a small, dark world? If some grand measurement and ordering of the Continent was attempted, there must have been a coordinating body or at least an efficient sharing of scientific secrets, and there are few signs of this in the unpromising debris of hill forts and farmsteads &#x2026;</p>
<p class="quotei">If no means of determining longitude was devised before Hipparchos, how did Hannibal, for instance, manage to navigate his way along the Heraklean diagonal, and how was he able to rejoin the solar path after being forced to deviate from it? How could the pathways of the Celts have been anything but a wonderful mirage? A clue can be found, surprisingly, in Pliny the Elder&#x2019;s credulous encyclopaedia of wonders, <i>Historia Naturalis</i> (c. 78 <small>AD</small>). In a chapter which is bizarre even by Pliny&#x2019;s standards, he describes two ancient &#x2018;experiments,&#x2019; the purpose and result of which escaped him almost entirely. He knew only that they had something to do with the curvature of the earth, which &#x2018;discovers and hides some things to some, and others to others.&#x2019; Someone had evidently tried to explain to Pliny the problem of longitude.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">It seems that with each new season, the earliest dates for megalithic structures in Western Europe get pushed back another millennia or so. The vast majority of them are postdiluvian, but at least some of the sites now look to be antediluvian in the sense of first being used before the end of the Ice Age. (And there may well be more under the cold waters off Britain&#x2019;s northeast coast.)</p>
<p class="indent">Consider the fascinating story of what we now call the Megalithic Yard. In a fine example of relentlessness, an Oxford professor of engineering science, Alexander Thom, ruined nearly fifty of his wife and friends&#x2019; summers by packing them off all over Brittany and the British Isles, measuring megalithic sites, year after year. By the end of his life, he had built a database of megalithic measurements that has yet to be surpassed today. He claimed to have discovered three units of ancient measurement that he called the Megalithic Yard (2.722 ft), the Megalithic Rod (2.5 MY) and a Megalithic Inch (one fortieth of a MY).</p>
<p class="indent">Obviously this did not go down well &#x2013; and has not gone down well &#x2013; with historians
<a id="page_125"></a>
whose theories do not match the statistical facts found by an actual professor of engineering. How could a preliterate society create a unified system of measurement across so diverse a terrain?</p>
<p class="indent">Easily, it turns out. All you need is time, which our ancestors certainly had. You could ball up some dung on a horse hair, create a pendulum and end up with an accurate measurement for both the circumference of the earth and the moon. From Christopher Knight and Alan Butler&#x2019;s <i>Before the Pyramids</i>:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">We think it is fair to suggest that the first machine ever invented by man was the plumb-bob/pendulum. A small ball of clay on the end of a piece of twine or long strand of straight hair is a wonderful device that interacts with the Earth in a very predictable way. Held stationary, it will always point down to the centre of the planet, which allows the user to check verticals during construction of any sort. Verticals are also necessary for good observational astronomy. When the device is swung gently to and fro in the hand it becomes a timekeeper, like a modern metronome (which is only an inverted pendulum).</p>
<p class="quotei">But the real beauty about pendulums is that their frequency with which they swing is only determined by their length, so if you count a set number of beats for a given period of time (such as the period it takes a star to traverse a known gap), you will always end up with the same pendulum length.</p>
<p class="quotei">We found that half a Megalithic Yard pendulum was the origin of the whole measurement system rediscovered by Thom.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">With a few bits of wood and twine, an ancient engineer could confidently calculate the circumference of the earth. He or she would face east and observe the rising of a star or planet and then observe where they descended over an artificial horizon like the top of a henge or part of an observational platform, counting pendulum swings between the rising and the setting of these astral bodies. When Christopher Knight ran his suggestions by a chartered civil engineer by the name of Jim Russell, this is the response he got:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">If I wanted to study the movement of the planets and stars without modern instruments, I would need a fixed point from which to make measurements. I would need middle distance reference points to check the star and planet movements against an artificial horizon. Ideally I would be within shouting distance of my assistant placing the reference points 360 (or 366) degrees around my reference point (right a bit, left a bit, SPOT ON).</p>
<p class="space"/>
<a id="page_126"></a>
<p class="indent">These hypothetical descriptions are highly resonant with the mysterious &#x2018;Stretching of the Cord&#x2019; ceremony that the Egyptian king and priestess of Seshat were required to perform in the laying out of pyramids, the astronomical alignments of which have boggled our minds for thousands of years. We are approaching a solution to the observable fact that the dimensions of the earth are encoded in the construction of the Great Pyramid without recourse to alien space ships. One final quote from Christopher Knight on that subject.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">Neolithic sky-watchers would clearly have understood that there were two constantly repeating patterns taking place &#x2013; the day and the year. It is almost impossible that they would have failed to realize that the daily pattern fitted into the yearly pattern 366 times. As far as they were concerned, the year was a great circle of 366 days in duration and so the origin of the degree of arc as 1/366th of a circle. By contrast, the modern convention of 360&#x00B0; in a circle is as primitive as the ancient Egyptian year of 360 days &#x2013; it simply isn&#x2019;t correct. The two errors are entirely historically related, and though we now do at least use a year of 365 days, we never corrected the mistake regarding the number of degrees in a circle &#x2026;</p>
<p class="quotei">The ancient system of geometry has greatness running right through it. It divided the Earth&#x2019;s polar circumference into 366&#x00B0; and then subdivided each degree into 60 minutes of an arc, with 6 seconds to each minute. And, amazingly, each second of the arc is exactly 366 MY in length.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">To sum up, count 366 swings of a pendulum between the rising and setting of, say, Venus, between two artificial markers and the length of your pendulum is half a Megalithic Yard. 366 is the number of days in an ancient year and the number of degrees in an ancient circle. The unit of measurement you have created can also be used to calculate the circumference of the Earth, because 366 Megalithic Yards is exactly one second of its arc. This same number, 366 Megalithic Yards, is precisely equivalent to 1,000 Minoan Yards. As for the Egyptians, if you create a circle that has a circumference of one Megalithic Yard, then this circle has a diameter of one royal cubit. And the remen, an ancient Egyptian unit of measurement for land and roads, is the hypotenuse of a square around the Megalithic Yard circle.</p>
<p class="indent">Squaring the circle. Imagine that. If you are as confused as Pliny about now, do not worry. The point is that there is a universal unit of length found in Minoan Crete, the earliest architecture of Ancient Egypt and Northwest European megaliths that can deliver an accurate measurement of the earth using some clay, twine and a few magical friends. It is a mathematical impossibility that this exact unit of measurement was
<a id="page_127"></a>
arrived at randomly by at least three separate cultures and that they also accidentally calculated the true circumference of the Earth.</p>
<p class="image"><a id="ch06fig10"></a><img src="images/f0127-01.jpg" class="width262" width="262" height="261" alt="images"/></p>
<p class="fig"><a href="05_Illustrations.xhtml#rch06fig10"><i><span class="fig">fig. 10</span> The relationship between the Megalithic Yard and the Egyptian remen</i></a></p>
<p class="indent">Christopher Knight&#x2019;s subsequent explanation for this, that colonists from the British Isles may have influenced the culture development of the Minoans and Egyptians lacks mythological or genetic support. Nevertheless, that is merely an interpretation. His mathematical facts are sound. Given the available genetic and cultural data, it seems more likely to me that we need to &#x2018;step up&#x2019; the family tree and look for a common origin for these measurements.</p>
<p class="indent">The time-depth for a common origin of megalithic measurements puts us squarely back before the end of the Ice Age and is very likely a form of Laurasian &#x2018;high magical technology.&#x2019; Appearing at the very latest just after the end of the Ice Age &#x2013; and thus by definition having been developed during it &#x2013; we perceive a way of viewing the universe that links the number of days in a year to the number of swings of a pendulum, to the layout of sacred sites, to the circumference of the earth and all tied back to the movements of the stars. We see the macrocosm of the night sky linked by skilled observers to the microcosm of our smallest moments, a map of both the inner and outer universe. We see the development of ancient navigational techniques into a precision magical system for use on land. We see proto-hermeticism writ large.</p>
