<p class="indent" style="margin-top:2em;">Let us begin with a story of two brothers. One is industrious, the other is lazy and feckless. The feckless one killed his industrious brother and then tried to deny the act to their father. The father curses his murdering son and sends him into exile, along with all his descendants. A similar story is told in New Guinea. Dr Oppenheimer suggests these tales may be mythological memories of population changes associated with the peopling of the Pacific. There are numerous stories detailing family squabbles and brothers leaving with their families for distant islands so there is much to commend this suggestion.</p>
<p class="indent">Similarly, wherever the first variant of Cain and Abel was told, it seems pretty clear it a mythological memory of hunter gatherers and early farmers uneasily living in the same space. It may well be that the Tongan, New Guinean and Near Eastern variants are, in fact, localisations of the exact same incident. Even if they are not, the &#x2018;warring brothers&#x2019; mytheme is a component of the Laurasian &#x2018;novel.&#x2019; There are multiple examples
<a id="page_83"></a>
of Laurasian mythology right across the Pacific. Essentially, every story in the first ten or so books of the Bible is found in the mythology of Melanesia and Polynesia. The parallels are so startling that the first missionaries to arrive thought they had discovered the lost tribe of Israel.</p>
<p class="indent">These glaring similarities have led to some confused hypotheses over the years, such as a South American or even Babylonian origin for the Pacific peoples. Today we have the Laurasian framework and genetic information pointing to an older, shared origin to understand why these parallels exist. The watery creation, the separation of sky and earth, the creation of man from earth and woman from his side, the duelling brothers, the flood. All are in evidence and all had to come from somewhere. Which brings us to geography.</p>
<p class="indent">It is not often evident when looking at a flat map, but the Pacific Ocean is a hemisphere. The colonisation of its tiny islands is a feat of exploration unmatched until the moon landing. Beginning in the Southwest Pacific, the first grouping of islands to the east of New Guinea is known as Melanesia, meaning &#x2018;middle islands.&#x2019; Further east from them &#x2013; including New Zealand, Hawaii and Easter Island &#x2013; is Polynesia, meaning &#x2018;many islands.&#x2019; To the north of New Guinea, the islands &#x2013; including Guam, Pohnpei, Chuuk and Yap &#x2013; are known as Micronesia, which you can probably guess means &#x2018;small islands.&#x2019;</p>
<p class="indent">The origin of the Austronesian-speaking, agricultural, open-ocean-navigating Polynesians is finally undergoing a rare academic sea change (if you&#x2019;ll excuse the pun). Previously, it was stated that the Austronesian-speaking Polynesians emerged from mainland Asia via Taiwan, bringing with them a distinctive pottery style, known as Lapita, around 1500 <small>BCE</small>, sailed to Melanesia and then quickly &#x2013; we are talking a scant few centuries &#x2013; colonised the entirety of Polynesia, all the way to Easter Island. This is despite the fact there is no evidence for Lapita pottery in mainland Asia and, as we saw in the preceding chapter, no evidence for an Austronesian language homeland there, either.</p>
<p class="indent">When combined with the more recent genetic evidence, and even sites like Gunung Padang, frankly, it becomes clear that the continuity of culture in Eastern Melanesia is very long-lived indeed. We are dealing with cultural groups that have been occupying this area since before the end of the Ice Age. Lapita pottery is certainly excellent evidence of trade and migration around 800 <small>BCE</small>, but we need to consider the &#x2018;mystery&#x2019; of the Polynesian homeland solved. It is under the sea, just where they have always said it was.</p>
<p class="indent">Whenever they first made it to Melanesia, these Ice Age &#x2018;climate refugees&#x2019; existed in a state of near total isolation right up until the arrival of Europeans. As such, they offer us the best example on earth of a &#x2018;control group&#x2019; to ascertain which elements of the western magical tradition may be antediluvian survivals and specifically survivals from a sunken homeland. Hence the interest we must pay to their mythologies.</p>

<a id="page_85"></a>
<p class="indent">Comparative mythology works best when you have a control group. If we wish to ascertain which aspects of magical cosmology predate the end of the Ice Age, and where and in which order they developed, then we should try and find a place on earth which, since the sea levels rose, has had as little molestation as possible. This place is the Pacific in general and Polynesia in particular. Dr Oppenheimer once again:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="quote">The Polynesians&#x2019; spiritual life was rich with large pantheons. In all groups the Sun God was paramount and in some he was called Ra, as in Ancient Egypt. Almost without exception their myths recalled a lost earthly paradise to the west or the northwest, called variously Avaiki and Bolutu. A story similar to Adam and Eve is widespread, with most languages using ivi as the word for a bone. A story of two brothers of different cultures having a fight was prevalent. The ancestors of these people, and their Austro-Asiatic-speaking neighbours now on the Asian mainland, founded the first complex societies in Southeast Asia. While cereal agriculture was a mainland development, hierarchical societies, the concept of kingship, magic, religion and astronomy were features of the maritime coastal Austronesian peoples. What I suggest here is that these development preceded similar changes in western Asia, and that in their dispersals the Southeast Asian explorers fertilized the Neolithic cultures of China, India, Mesopotamia, Egypt and Crete.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">One of my enduring memories of shooting a documentary in Pohnpei was just how over-governed the islands were. Layer after layer of kingship, conferred by blood and ultimately the stars. In almost every case across Micronesia and Polynesia, these tribal and governmental authorities originate in a sunken homeland. It is this mismatch between cultural complexity, its origin and the total amount of land &#x2018;under management,&#x2019; so to speak, that has tripped up atlantologists for more than two centuries and led to them (and me at least once) launching diving expeditions off the coast of Pacific islands in search of sunken ruins.</p>
<p class="indent">The Pacific is one of the few places on earth where the archaeology, genetics and local mythologies are actually in alignment. Maori iwi can trace their descendants back a specific number of generations to the waka they arrived on. We can be reasonably confident regarding the dates of colonisation of Pacific islands. This is not to say they were not known of or even used before these dates, of course. In fact they very probably were, as we shall see. But the earliest dates for the <i>continuous occupation</i> of
<a id="page_86"></a>
some of the farther flung islands by these specific cultures is not going to move much beyond the second half of the first millennium <small>CE</small>, thousands of years after the end of the Ice Age.</p>
<p class="indent">Magic does not warp very often. Ritual magic is inherently conservative. Laurasian magic in particular is entirely predicated on following the correct procedure. In the books of Jake Stratton-Kent you can observe this inherent conservation of form even as Mesopotamian and Greek gods and daimons become the spirits and demons of the grimoires. And so we must read the following myths with both an eye for overlapping cosmology and one for continuity of ritual function. The very best data points for such a counter check are twinkling above our heads.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>GONDWANA STAR LORE</b></p>
<p class="indent">Let us briefly return to Sunda and Sahul land and the first arrival of our ancestors 50,000 years ago. What is so important to understand is that this area formed the ideal sailing nursery. Sundaland itself, when still above sea level, had an interior with dozens of rivers that would have required some form of vessels or logs to cross. The coastal landscape was one of repeated bays and islets. Also, winds across the Wallace Line, a species boundary line that separates Borneo and Sumatra (Sundaland) with New Guinea and Australia (Sahul land), reversed with the seasons. This meant that even if you got &#x2018;trapped&#x2019; on landmasses east of home, you could always rely on a breeze to get you back eventually.</p>
<p class="indent">Similar seasonal effects to do with wind and current reversals are found right across Island Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific. The ocean could be read in a way that is entirely opaque to modern eyes. Water colouration, the appearance of certain birds, how the light refracts at the horizon, the arrival of bioluminescent plankton or fish at certain times of the year, these were the compasses and sextants of the Sundaland people. Over the horizon travel and deep water fishing were occurring by 30,000 <small>BCE</small>. Today, the Torres Strait Islanders &#x2013; who we will meet below &#x2013; use stellar scintillation, stars&#x2019; twinkling effect, to determine levels of moisture and turbulence in the atmosphere, enabling them to predict weather patterns. Planets are of no use to them because they do not twinkle. I believe this behaviour may have been more widespread and could be significant in determining why stellar mythology predates planetary mythology.</p>
<p class="indent">Eclipsing the flawed &#x2018;mainland Asia&#x2019; theory for the origins of the Polynesian argonauts is a model devised by Wilhelm Solheim known as the Nusantao Maritime Trading and Communication Network (NMTCN). Taking the name Nusantao from <i>nusa</i> meaning &#x2018;south&#x2019; and <i>tao</i> meaning &#x2018;man/people,&#x2019; Solheim posits a multidirectional
<a id="page_87"></a>
expansion of an open-ocean trading network centred in what was then eastern Indonesia or possibly the Philippines. He suggests that the single-outrigger canoe was invented around 13,000 years ago, just before the end of the Ice Age, and that open ocean trading occurred principally in the Sunda and Sahul areas but also stretching north up to Japan and as far west as Madagascar by 5,000 <small>BCE</small>. His evidence is both archaeological: obsidian trading, etc; and linguistic: the footprint of the Austronesian language. Much like the earliest sailing nursery, the vast distances between Southeast Asia, Madagascar and probably all the way to Africa were reliably navigable thanks to the Monsoon winds. Over a 12 month period you could catch them one way and then catch them back home again. The NMTCN was the vector for the transmission of ideas, genes and artefacts across half the world and it is from these cultures that the Polynesian argonauts developed and went on to ultimately colonise the Pacific.</p>
<p class="indent">So even before the end of the Ice Age, you have an extant sailing nursery that develops over millennia from rafts to canoes to outrigger canoes that becomes a demi-global trading network once much of the land sinks beneath the ocean. And where you have a sailing nursery, you have what we can cheekily call a stellar nursery.</p>
<p class="indent">The University of New South Wales&#x2019;s Duane Hamacher is doing amazing work in the field of Indigenous Australian astronomy and astrotheology. Much of it involves investigating the oral survival of stories of ancient meteor impacts and volcanic eruptions and the like. It thus provides a useful counterpoint to Dr Witzel&#x2019;s dismissal of the possibility that mythology can encode memories of actual events because Hamacher has demonstrated that it clearly can. This information has been a long time coming. Most non-Australians are only dimly aware of just how raw the deal was that the First Australians received, even by colonial standards. They were not even included on the census as members of the Commonwealth until 1967 and, to this day, there is a widespread belief that no Aboriginal counting system went above the number four. Such were the racial headwinds preventing a thorough examining of Australia&#x2019;s indigenous astromythology.</p>
<p class="indent">In many ways, this is surprising. So much of indigenous life is defined by astronomy. The sun, moon and stars are used for time-keeping, hunting calendars, navigation over land and sea, as well as informing customs, taboos and social hierarchies. Knowledge of the night sky is transmitted through ritual, song, story, rock art, and the arrangement of sacred stones. The traditions associated with certain asterisms are used to describe the origins of man, animals and the landscape. Quite a number of these asterisms represent, to my mind, Gondwana-era spirits that have survived into the modern day, making them tens of thousands of years older than western esotericists commonly assume.</p>
<a id="page_88"></a>
<p class="indent">Some examples, then, beginning with my personal favourite, from the Arrernte people of the western Central Desert. During the Dreaming, a group of women/stars were dancing a <i>corroboree</i> (ceremony) beside the Milky Way. One of the star women put her baby down in its <i>coolamon</i> (basket) beside the Milky Way. Because they were dancing, the women did not notice that the baby and its coolamon fell to earth, driving the ground up where it landed. The coolamon fell on top of the baby and hid it from its distraught parents, who, to this day, search for it every night. They are the Morning Star and the Evening Star. The coolamon can still be seen in the night sky under the Milky Way, falling to earth. It is the Southern Cross.</p>
<p class="indent">Are we spying an early version of the &#x2018;Baby by the River&#x2019; motif commonly found in the Near East? Perhaps. In the case of Orion and the Pleiades, however, I will put money on it. Hamacher points out that many Aboriginal cultures associate Orion with groups of young men, particularly hunters or fishermen. The asterism and its associated stories often form the basis of important male initiation rites. In the Yolngu language, Orion is called <i>Djulpan</i>. The three belt stars are three brothers sitting in a canoe, across its width. Betelgeuse is the front of the canoe and Rigel is the back. The brothers were blown into the sky for illegally capturing a kingfish &#x2013; i.e. violating a taboo. The kingfish is what we would call Orion&#x2019;s sword.</p>
<p class="indent">Another story from the Central Desert has Orion, called <i>Nyeeruna</i>, chase the seven sisters of the Pleiades known as the <i>Yugarilya</i>. He is kept apart from them by the eldest sister, <i>Kambugudha</i>, who is the Hyades asterism. Kambugudha constantly counters Nyeeruna&#x2019;s fire magic and club with her own fire magic, while other astral bodies taunt him for his failures.</p>
<p class="indent">All in all, 90% of the collected Aboriginal stories associate Orion with a hunter or hunters and the Pleiades with a woman or a group of women. Noting the high degree of similarity between European and Indigenous Australian mythemes, Hamacher observes, &#x2018;This may indicate either cultural convergent evolution, reflecting the subjective masculine and feminine appearance of Orion and the Pleiades respectively, or else suggest a much earlier story common to both cultural roots.&#x2019; The former suggestion is one of those pseudoscientific glosses common to academia when it is confronted by the latter suggestion and its implications.</p>
<p class="indent">Stories of the stars are also used for timekeeping and maintaining hunter gatherer calendars. Staying in the Central Desert, when the Pleiades rise with the morning sun, the Pitjantjatjara people know that the dingoes are pupping. Kambugudha placed dingo pups between Nyeeruna and her sisters in one telling of the Orion legend. In Victoria, the Wergaia traditions tell of a time when the people faced drought and starvation. A woman called Marpeankurric went out searching for food for her tribe.
<a id="page_89"></a>
Eventually she found a nest and dug up thousands of nutritious ant larvae that sustained her people through the drought. Upon her death, she ascended to the sky and became the star Arcturus. When Marpeankurric rises in the evening, the local people know it is the time of the year to harvest the ant larvae.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER STAR LORE</b></p>
<p class="indent">The Torres Strait Islands are located between Australia&#x2019;s northernmost tip and Papua New Guinea. There are 250 islands over 48,000 kilometres of shallow ocean water. Fourteen of the islands are inhabited.</p>
<p class="indent">Although Torres Strait Islanders are Indigenous Australians, they are not Aborigines but are, in fact, Melanesians. Their culture dates back 8,000 years when the islands were formed at the end of the Ice Age. As such, their highly sophisticated astromythology affords us one of the best attempts to recreate the cosmology of the sunken Sahul and Sunda areas at the time of their inundation. I believe it is here that we can see &#x2018;missing link species&#x2019; between Gondwana and Laurasian mythology. It may be we are looking at the &#x2018;first draft&#x2019; of Dr Witzel&#x2019;s novel.</p>
<p class="indent">As you would expect, Orion and the Pleiades feature, as Utimal and Usmal. Their rising in the November skies tells the islanders to plant their gardens in advance of the Kuki season, a time when strong winds and heavy rain blow from the northwest and the intervals between the storms feature no wind at all. This is not good sailing weather. Utimal and Usmal also mark the time when the turtles and dugong are breeding.</p>
<p class="indent">Appealing on a personal level, there is the stellar shark, Baidam, which is comprised of some of the stars of Ursa Major. When Baidam appears in the skies over New Guinea, the islanders know it is time to start planting sweet potato and banana. When Baidam&#x2019;s nose touches the horizon at sunset, it is tiger shark breeding season &#x2013; very much not a time you want to be in or on the water.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>Tagai</b></p>
<p class="indent">Tagai is the principal Torres Strait Islander creation deity in a very Gondwanan sense of the term: he is the culture hero from whom the laws and customs descend but he did not create the universe. He is a great fisherman whose form encompasses several asterisms in the southern sky: the Southern Cross is his left hand holding a spear, his right hand is the constellation Corvus and he stands in a canoe that is formed by the stars of Scorpius.</p>
<p class="indent">One day, Tagai descended from the stars to go fishing in his outrigger canoe with a crew of 12 <i>zugubals</i>, beings who take on human form when they descend to earth. Unable to catch anything, Tagai leaves the canoe to try spearfishing on a nearby reef.
<a id="page_90"></a>
He tells the crew not to drink his water while he is gone. The zugubals finish all their own water and, because it is a very hot day, they then drink Tagai&#x2019;s water &#x2013; violating a taboo. Tagai returns and finds all his water gone. Furious, he kills them all, separates them into two groups of six and returns them to the sky, where they form the constellations of Usmal (Pleiades) and Utimal (Orion), thus providing another men/hunters/Orion connection. So angry is Tagai that he places the two groups of zugubals in the northern half of the sky and demands they never come near him, which is why Tagai stays in the southern half of the sky.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>PERSISTENCE AND DEVELOPMENT</b></p>
<p class="indent">It is clear that many Gondwana elements such as the Rainbow Serpent, the violation of taboo and the origin of humans and tribal technology have persisted in the night sky. The stars are a remarkable storage facility for cultural knowledge. It is my contention that the development of star lore from &#x2018;tribal library&#x2019; to &#x2018;life cycle calendar&#x2019; to ever more precise navigational systems is in some way associated with the rise of Laurasian mythology, and thus astrology and western magic. It is important to realise that &#x2018;development&#x2019; in this context does not mean &#x2018;evolutionary improvement&#x2019; but rather the additional layering of complexity into the continuation of earlier star lore. Consider that using spirit beings represented by asterisms such as Baidam or Tagai to navigate is to literally be guided by specific gods, and the ability to predict their arrival, timing and movements is to have either the power of, or power over, the gods. The stories associated with these beings and their asterisms remain. They have simply had an additional function layered onto them.</p>
<p class="indent">Eventually, continual improvements in the accuracy of prediction may have given rise to the &#x2018;magical immortality tech&#x2019; of the Vedic, Harappan and Near Eastern civilisations, in particular, the rise to prominence of the planets over the constellations. Planets are almost useless to navigators, obviously, but they are very useful if you are in the business of creating and running a royal mythological calendar. Their movements are more rapid, more dramatic, and thus require the shamans and nascent priestly class to demonstrate ever more complex mathematical abilities. It is to that increasing complexity that we now turn.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>SPLENDID ISOLATION</b></p>
<p class="indent">The Polynesians have an unmistakably Laurasian cosmology and are self-evidently the planet&#x2019;s best ancient navigators. As a control group they are very useful in calibrating the continuation of Palaeolithic forms &#x2013; the spirits as asterisms &#x2013; within the &#x2018;civilisational&#x2019; context of the post-Ice Age era. When examining the following
<a id="page_91"></a>
mythemes, it is useful to consider again the words that open this chapter: &#x2018;may have retained their original culture with least dilution.&#x2019; It is very unlikely we are looking at the direct transfer of the cosmology of a sunken land. These are purely Polynesian myths. They are, however, the best pieces we have available to attempt any hypothetical reconstruction. For those unfamiliar with Polynesia, the many similarities to the western esoteric tradition are remarkable. By the time we reach Eastern Polynesia, you will feel right at home.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>Tangaroa</b></p>
<p class="indent">The god of the ocean and most commonly the creator. Depending on the island, Tangaroa is also called <i>Tagaloa</i> (Tongan), <i>Ta&#x2019;aroa</i> (Tahitian), <i>Kanaloa</i> (Maori), <i>Tangaloa</i> (Hawaiian). In the Marquesas, Tangaroa is called Tanaoa and is the god of the Primeval Darkness. In other islands he is known simply as <i>A&#x2019;a</i>. (A&#x2019;a is also a Hawaiian name for Sirius.) It is interesting to note the phonic similarities found in Polynesian mythology with Ra &#x2013; sun god in the Pacific and Egypt &#x2013; and the Sumerian Ea, nearly identical to A&#x2019;a.</p>
<p class="indent">So huge is Tangaroa that he only breathes twice every two hours, which causes the low and high tides on the ocean. In the Tahitian story, <i>Ta&#x2019;aroa</i> means &#x2018;Unique One,&#x2019; which I interpret to mean &#x2018;First, Alone.&#x2019; Before creation he lived in the Cosmic Egg, turning endlessly in infinite darkness. In some versions of the story, the eggshell is all that separates earth and sky. One day he cracked the egg and called out. The empty universe did not respond. He threw part of his shell into the air to create the heavens. He used the other part to create the rocks and the sand. Angry and horrified at his empty universe, he dismembered himself and built Creation. In the Tuamotu version of this act, he made the clouds out of his skin, the mountains from his spine, the fertile earth from his flesh, the trees from his feathers, the fish from his nails, the crustaceans and eels from his innards and he used his blood to dye the sky red. Only then did the first day dawn. Throughout this act of dismemberment, Ta&#x2019;aroa remained Ta&#x2019;aroa, and in his head he conjured into existence all the other gods. His shell, despite being broken, also remained as the principal point of creation, and everything became its own version of this shell: thus the earth is a complete shell, the human body is a complete shell, and so on. Everything is &#x2018;shell shaped,&#x2019; reflecting its ultimate origin in the cosmic egg.</p>
<p class="indent">Here we find the expected mytheme of the universe being created from a dismembered giant. More interestingly we have a creation story that looks Brahmanic and a microcosm/macrocosm view of the universe as Mind of God that you would be forgiven for mistaking as Hermetic.</p>
<a id="page_92"></a>
<p class="h3"><b>Tane</b></p>
<p class="indent">Staying with the Tuamotu, Tane was the second son of Atea, the Sky Father. They eventually fought for rulership like Zeus and Chronos.</p>
<p class="indent">In the Maori stories of Tane, he is the son of Rangi, the Sky Father and Papa, the Earth Mother. Tane separated the eternal embrace of his parents so that light could enter the world. He was constantly battling with his brother the storm god Tawhiri. There is not a single part of this story that is not found in Egypt.</p>
<p class="indent">Tane is also known as the Lord of the Forests, <i>Tane-Mahuta</i>. Tawhiri chased Tane&#x2019;s fish children from the forests into the ocean where they were ruled by Tangaroa. These are probably the <i>Taiparu</i> or &#x2018;Peerless Ones,&#x2019; a Pacific version of faery beings, as Tane was their lord. There are repeated fish/star symbol crossovers in the Pacific and Southern India. It is interesting to note the fish symbolism of wisdom teachers in places such as Sumeria, probably noting their descent from particular gods/asterisms.</p>
<p class="indent">In an act with faintly biblical overtones, after separating his parents, Tane covered his father&#x2019;s nakedness with the God of Mists, <i>Kohu</i>, the Milky Way, called <i>Ika-Roa</i>, and their children, who were the stars.</p>
<p class="indent">When Tane&#x2019;s mother, Papa (confusing, I know), refused his sexual advances Tane created the first woman out of Hawaiian sands, <i>Hine-hau-one</i>, or &#x2018;Earth Girl.&#x2019; Their daughter, <i>Hine-nui-te-po</i> also subsequently refused her father&#x2019;s advances and fled to the Underworld where she became the goddess of Death. Note the &#x2018;Nuit&#x2019; in the name.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>Maui</b></p>
<p class="indent">Maui could be the archetypal civilising trickster. In some variants of the &#x2018;separation of sky and earth,&#x2019; this feat is accomplished by Maui, not Tane.</p>
<p class="indent">When he was born prematurely, Maui&#x2019;s mother threw him into the ocean, paralleling the numerous &#x2018;abandoned baby by the water&#x2019; motifs. He lengthened the daylight hours so that humans had more time for work by slowing the sun using his dead grandmother&#x2019;s jawbone; a fairly transparent piece of astrotheology.</p>
<p class="indent">Maui also stole fire from the people of the underworld and gave it to mankind. In another adventure in the underworld, Maui attempted to achieve immortality by passing through the vagina of his grandmother Hine-nui-te-po, the goddess of Death, and out her mouth. He failed and was killed, triggering the permanent withdrawal of immortality as an option for humans and beginning the taboo against incest.</p>
<p class="indent">Stories of Maui also contain a dragon-slaying motif. The wife of a giant sea eel, <i>Te Tuna</i> (&#x2018;The Penis&#x2019;) ran away and began a passionate affair with Maui. Eventually Te Tuna sought her out, triggering a tidal wave with his penis as he approached land. Maui deflected the wave by displaying his own penis. They fought and sexually
<a id="page_93"></a>
entered each other before Maui was ultimately victorious, beheading Te Tuna and burying his head. From his head sprouted the first coconut tree, which gave mankind solid and liquid sustenance. The violent sexual encounter has echoes of the story of Set and Horus, among others. As is common with the Trickster motif, many of Maui&#x2019;s stories are sexually graphic, if not downright bawdy.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>The Sacred Tree</b></p>
<p class="indent">Maui&#x2019;s is not the only motif associated with the coconut tree, as you might expect. Genetically American, the presence of the coconut across every piece of habitable land in Polynesia is physical evidence of sustained trans-oceanic adventures thousands and thousands of years ago. Given the shape of the coconut, many of the stories involve decapitation. I suspect, however, that this is a genus-specific version of a wider shamanic/tree spirit/dismemberment story.</p>
<p class="indent">From eastern Papua, one story involves a man who would always return at the end of each day with his basket full of fish. Jealous, the other men followed him to the beach one morning to discover his secret. On the beach, the man removed his head and stowed it under a bush before walking into the water. Once in the water, all the nearby fish swam into his gullet. Returning to land, he vomited them all up, restored his head to his shoulders, threw the small ones back into the ocean and placed the large ones in his basket. The next morning the other men took the fisherman&#x2019;s head and buried it. When he returned to the beach and found it gone, he fled back into the sea, turned into a fish and was never seen again. Where the head was buried sprouted a coconut tree. Interestingly, it was a woman who first tasted its magical flesh, just as in the Eden story.</p>
<p class="indent">The coconut origin story from the island of Djaul involves even more dismemberment. Two brothers were returning to land with their canoe laden with fish when the sea giant, Lumukaka, appeared. They threw the fish to him and fled but Lumukaka pursued them. The younger brother told his older brother to cut off his arm and throw it to the sea giant. This only slowed him a little so he told his brother to cut off his other arm. And then his two legs. By the time they reached land, the younger brother was just a torso and a head. The boys&#x2019; grandfather said to bury the younger brother&#x2019;s head, which they did. The next day the older brother went to the burial site and found a puppy. His grandfather said to leave it alone because it will turn into a coconut tree that will provide food, drink and firewood, which it did.</p>
<p class="indent">The puppy element is interesting given the role of canines as gatekeepers between the human world and the otherworld. Beyond this, the dismemberment/sacred tree motif is seen (along with a canine) in the story of Osiris who is dismembered
<a id="page_94"></a>
and trapped in cedar. Contained in the tree/immortality story we have the repeated refrains of the trickster and the hunter/fisherman. In the case of Osiris this gives us another overlap with the constellation of Orion.</p>
<p class="indent">Dr Oppenheimer suggests that the sacred tree/sustaining life motif may have had its origin in the earliest days of Sundaland with the indigenous banana tree; the coconut still millennia from appearing on Sunda beaches. In a very literal sense, the banana tree is the father of a tribe because of its abundance and caloric density allowing for population growth. It is also interesting to note in passing that the banana shares 50% of its DNA with mankind.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>Atutuahi</b></p>
<p class="indent">Atutuahi is the star Canopus, hymned as &#x2018;the Mother of the Moon and Stars.&#x2019; Sometimes male, Atutuahi is one of the primary stars used by the Polynesians for open ocean navigation, equivalent to the Northern Hemisphere&#x2019;s Pole Star. (There is no Pole Star in the Southern Hemisphere and there will not be one for around 2,000 years.)</p>
<p class="indent">Phil Coppens, in <i>The Canopus Revelation</i> mentions that the lack of awareness of the primacy of Canopus in Ancient Egypt is odd and may be due to the fact that the star is not visible in the skies of Western Europe; home to most of the world&#x2019;s Egyptologists. Though his underlying thesis that Canopus is the &#x2018;true&#x2019; Osirian star lacks credible evidence, the association is nevertheless there in part (along with Khonsu) and could be due to a survival of the much earlier association of Orion and canoes/fishing, given its subsequent Greek association with ships and the Argo. Consider Coppens&#x2019;s characterisation of the status of Canopus in Hinduism; the star is known as <i>Agastya</i>, a Rishi (sage). It is the helmsman of Argha, son of Varuna, goddess of the waters.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>The Serpent and the Tree</b></p>
<p class="indent">Returning to the tree, we have repeated serpent/tree symbolism that contains hybrid versions of the serpent/civilising trickster from Gondwana mythology and the more familiar serpent/tree/taboo symbolism from Laurasian stories.</p>
<p class="indent">On the North New Guinean island of Siar, there is a legend of a group of hunters catching a snake in a tree. They decide they will eat it the next day. That evening, all the women of the group had a dream where the snake told them, &#x2018;if you eat me, the whole tribe will be drowned.&#x2019; Only one woman took the dream seriously and sailed away with her two children, a boy and a girl. The other tribesfolk ate the snake and the village sank beneath the ocean. The woman&#x2019;s two children are the ancestors of Siar and the nearby islands.</p>
<a id="page_95"></a>
<p class="indent">In Fiji, the giant serpent, <i>Degei</i>, who had always existed, lived in the sky with one other being, a she-hawk called <i>Turukawa</i>. One day, Turukawa laid two eggs, one containing a human boy and the other containing a human girl. Degei kept the eggs warm in his coils until they hatched. Degei then created the banana tree to feed them as children. When they were grown, he taught them to grow and harvest yams and taro. He also gave them fire and taught them speech. Later these two children went on to populate the earth.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>Io</b></p>
<p class="indent"><i>Io</i> is a very common Polynesian name for the high creator god. Like &#x2018;Ra&#x2019; and &#x2018;Ea,&#x2019; which persist in Near Eastern and North African civilisations, I suspect this is an example of a very, very long-lived sacred syllable. Consider how close Ea, IAO, Yahweh and Io sound when said out loud. The word also means &#x2018;hawk&#x2019; in Hawaiian. Linguist and Pacific scholar Jan Knappert believed the word may have been taboo, replaced with <i>Atua</i>, which means &#x2018;Old One.&#x2019;</p>
<p class="indent">The most common story involves Io speaking light into being when there was only darkness upon the waters. He then contemplated light and called darkness back, creating the first day. It is also often Io that separates the sky from the land. In Maori mythology, Io is both god of the house and of knowledge. Some of his epithets were <i>Io-Te-Waiora</i>, &#x2018;Io, the Source of Life&#x2019; and <i>Io-Matua-Te-Kore</i>, &#x2018;Io who has no parents.&#x2019; The tale is told in a Maori hymn to Io:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="poem">lo dwelt within the breathing-space of immensity.</p>
<p class="poem">The Universe was in darkness, with water everywhere.</p>
<p class="poem">There was no glimmer of dawn, no clearness, no light.</p>
<p class="poem">And he began by saying these words,</p>
<p class="poem">That He might cease remaining inactive</p>
<p class="poem">&#x2018;<i>Darkness become a light-possessing darkness.&#x2019;</i></p>
<p class="poem">And at once light appeared.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="poem">(He) then repeated those self-same words in this manner.</p>
<p class="poem">That He might cease remaining inactive:</p>
<p class="poem"><i>Light, become a darkness-possessing light</i>.</p>
<p class="poem">And again an intense darkness supervened.</p>
<p class="poem">Then a third time He spake saying:</p>
<p class="poem">&#x2018;<i>Let there be one darkness above</i>,</p>
<p class="poem"><i>Let there be one darkness below</i>.</p>
<a id="page_96"></a>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="poem"><i>Let there be one light above</i>,</p>
<p class="poem"><i>Let there be one light below</i>,</p>
<p class="poem"><i>A dominion of light, a bright light</i>.&#x2019;</p>
<p class="poem">And now a great light prevailed.</p>
<p class="poem">(lo) then looked to the waters which compassed him about,</p>
<p class="poem">and spoke a fourth time, saying:</p>
<p class="poem">&#x2018;<i>Ye waters of Tai-kama, be ye separate. Heaven, be formed.&#x2019;</i></p>
<p class="poem">Then the sky became suspended. &#x2018;<i>Bring forth thou Tupua-horo-nuku.&#x2019;</i></p>
<p class="poem">And at once the moving earth lay stretched abroad.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">This comes from the 1907 <i>Journal of the Polynesian Society</i>, translated by Hare Hongi, which relates that these words were &#x2018;transmitted down through the generations. Our priests joyously referred to them as being the ancient and original sayings.&#x2019; The hymn was also used as an incantation to quicken barren wombs, to lift up depressive hearts and anywhere else that installation of a little Light may be useful.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>Castor and Pollux</b></p>
<p class="indent">In Polynesia, the stars of Gemini are known as <i>Hui Tarara</i>. In a parallel to Indian star lore, they were originally human and fled to the sky, becoming stars, when they heard they were to be separated.</p>
<p class="indent">Another name for Pollux is <i>Rehua</i>. He is the star god, living in the highest heavens, a realm no human has ever reached. His son, <i>Kaitangata</i>, fell to earth, and the blood from his fall is the sunset. Maui is descended from Rehua, the star god.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>The Moon</b></p>
<p class="indent">It is a common mistake to assume that traditional cultures saw the moon as female when it appears that a slim majority of them actually saw it as male. The suggestion for why this is so &#x2013; which I find credible &#x2013; is that in hunter-gatherer cultures, it was the men who &#x2018;went away&#x2019; or &#x2018;journeyed&#x2019; in hunting parties, just as the moon does. The sun is much more reliable and thus appears as female more often than you would expect. (Attending an Australian school, we used to sing an Aboriginal folk song called <i>sun-a-rise, she come every morning</i>.)</p>
<p class="indent">Thus is it unsurprising that the Polynesians saw the moon as male. Sort of. Yes, <i>Marama</i> is the moon god, but his wife <i>Ina</i> (or <i>Rona</i>) is the moon goddess. Think of them more as occupants of our satellite, rather than it being a manifestation of one or the other. Ina taught the women of the earth to weave baskets. In Hawaii, she is called <i>Hina</i> and is goddess of the fish. She taught Hawaiian women how to make barkcloth.</p>
<a id="page_97"></a>
<p class="indent">On the island of Aitutaki, Ina&#x2019;s husband was a human she took back up to the moon. When he showed signs of ageing, she created a rainbow bridge to send him back to earth so that he could die.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>Night and the Morning Star</b></p>
<p class="indent">Venus is known as <i>Kopu</i> or <i>Malara</i>, and, according to Jan Knappert, &#x2018;she is much admired for her beauty.&#x2019; As previously mentioned, the goddess of the night sky is called Hine-Nui-Te-Po, which I find highly suggestive of Nuit.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>Kingship</b></p>
<p class="indent">Consider how many &#x2018;alternative history&#x2019; books would have remained unwritten had we not confused <i>kings</i> descending from the stars with <i>kingship</i> descending from the stars! In Polynesia, a king, <i>ariki rahi</i>, became a divine being at the moment of his coronation. His kingship was ordained by and descended from the stars and his word became law.</p>
<p class="indent">I believe the increasing complexity in star lore over the millennia &#x2013; and in particular that first jump toward precise measurement that is in some way associated with the rise of the Laurasian &#x2018;novel&#x2019; &#x2013; has much to do with the emergence of divinely ordained, absolute rulers. Priests are ever putting &#x2018;their man&#x2019; on the throne. Correctly dating this concept throws a very unflattering light on some of the zanier origin theories for the Pharaohs and Sumerian kings.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>Spider</b></p>
<p class="indent">In Micronesia, the creator god is known as Nareau. Before creation, he walked alone through the primeval matter of <i>Te-Po-ma-Te-Maki</i>, &#x2018;the Darkness of the Embrace.&#x2019; Nareau used a giant eel to separate &#x2018;the embrace&#x2019; of earth and sky. He fashioned the first man and woman from earth and water. These two humans gave birth to several of the gods, including the god of the Waves; <i>Na Kika</i>, the octopus; and <i>Ruki</i>, the sea serpent.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>Aries</b></p>
<p class="indent">In Hawaii, the constellation of Aries is called <i>K&#x016B;kalani&#x2019;ehu</i>, &#x2018;K&#x016B; of the misty heavens.&#x2019; He is the god (<i>akua</i>) of war on Kaua&#x2019;i and O&#x2019;ahu.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>Pleiades</b></p>
<p class="indent">The rising of the seven star spirits of <i>Matariki</i>, &#x2018;little eyes&#x2019; in the skies above New Zealand in late May or early June is considered Maori new year. Just as we saw in
<a id="page_98"></a>
the Torres Strait, the cluster is a cornerstone of both agricultural and hunter-gatherer calendars across the Pacific.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>Milky Way</b></p>
<p class="indent">Considered the property of the Night Goddess in parts of Polynesia, the Milky Way is known as <i>Ika-Roa</i>, &#x2018;The Long Fish, who Gave Birth to all the Stars.&#x2019; Here the fish/star symbolism that I suspect we see in Sumeria is repeated. In some variants, Ika-Roa is simply the Mother of the Stars.</p>
<p class="indent">A Maori motif that has similarities to the Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal myths sees Tane gathering up clumps of little stars in his canoe and this is what forms the Milky Way, a rather beautiful image.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>Pyramids</b></p>
<p class="indent">It is not very widely known that pyramids and other stepped, sacred platforms were built on a very large scale across the Pacific. Most were razed by missionaries. They were called either <i>marae</i> or <i>morai</i>, which according to Jan Knappert meant they contained &#x2018;houses of god&#x2019; within them. One such structure in Tahiti measured 267 feet in length. Given the recent dating of Gunung Padang in Indonesia, and the fact that it was a large hill shaped into a step pyramid, the case for a Sahul/Sunda origin for this particular type of sacred architecture is considerably strengthened.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>RAPA NUIAN EXCEPTIONALISM</b></p>
<p class="indent">Rapa Nui, or Easter Island, has long fascinated historians and researchers of every stripe. It is probably the most isolated place on earth, being more than 2,000 kilometres away from the nearest inhabited island (Pitcairn, population: 67) and 3,700 kilometres off the Chilean coast. The enigmatic <i>moai</i> &#x2013; statues with elongated heads, tiny hands and piercing eyes &#x2013; stare out across the endless ocean with their mouths resolutely shut. If there is anywhere that absolutely breaks the mainstream model of Pacific history it is here. The accepted version of events does not stand up to even the slightest scrutiny. How could it? Officially, Rapa Nui was the last of the Pacific islands to be colonised, yet it has the most extreme examples of megalithic and astronomical culture found anywhere in the ocean.</p>
<p class="indent">The orthodox chronology is as follows:</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Rapa Nui is believed to have been first colonised between 700 <small>AD</small> and 1200 <small>AD</small>.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The population peaked at 15,000 but a combination of disease and mismanagement of resources dropped it down to around 3,000 by the time of European
<a id="page_99"></a>
contact a few centuries later. This would make it fairly unique in the over-managed Polynesian world.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The rulers had hundreds and hundreds of moai built &#x2018;to keep the farmers busy in the off season.&#x2019;</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> It was discovered by Dutch explorers on Easter Sunday, 1722, hence its name. By this point the local culture was in a degenerate state and very few of the Rapa Nui people could read their mysterious Rongorongo script.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">Let us have a closer look at these 887 moai, through the eyes of a tenured geologist, Dr Robert Schoch. In his <i>Forgotten Civilisation: The Role of Solar Outbursts in Our Past and Future</i>, he records the following observations from his visits to Rapa Nui.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The average weight for one of the moai is twelve tonnes. The largest is 75 tonnes and an unfinished moai, still in its quarry, is approximately 250 tonnes. Those farmers must have had a long off-season.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> There appear to different eras of moai building, with the earliest probably being carved from basalt. Dr Schoch observed some of these basalt moai had been repurposed into dwellings and sacred platforms, as well as showing signs of being recarved. (The moai in the British museum has later carving all down its back.) For a stone object to be repurposed it is, by definition, older than the structures it is incorporated into.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Despite the island&#x2019;s small land area, the basalt quarries have yet to be located. Based on his understanding of volcanic stratigraphy, Dr Schoch suggests they would not be found where the other quarries are located &#x2013; toward the top of the volcano &#x2013; but lower down, perhaps under the current sea level.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Probably the world&#x2019;s most famous <small>SCUBA</small> diver, Jacques Cousteau, observed large, rectangular cut-outs in underwater basalt that resemble the holes left in Rapa Nuian quarries. It is very unlikely the Rapa Nui were undersea miners, which begs the question of when these rectangular quarry marks were above sea level.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Just as with his observations of the water erosion on the Sphinx, Dr Schoch noticed varying levels of erosion on the moai, indicating dramatically different ages for some of them.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> Some of the moai have sedimentation built up around them to a depth of six metres. Based on an analysis of the difference in sedimentation between today and photos of the same moai from 130 years ago, Dr Schoch has calculated that some of the moai were installed at a vastly earlier date than is currently accepted by historians.</p>
<a id="page_100"></a>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> The long-fingered, thin-armed carvings on the moai are highly reminiscent of the T-pillars at G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe, even down to the way the hands rest on the abdomen, almost in an asana pose.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull">&#x2022;</span> There are shaped lava tunnels on Rapa Nui. If it transpires that the tunnels inside Gunung Padang in Indonesia are also shaped by human hands, and all available evidence suggests that is the case, then it may be another cultural continuity.</p>
<p class="space"/>
<p class="indent">All of these observations are in addition to the persistent challenge of how these multi-tonne objects were placed on their sacred platforms, called <i>ahu</i>. In many instances, the moai have been installed miles from where they were struck from the rock. Local legend says they were walked into place, or flew through the air by the use of mana. A similar story accounts for the appearance of the giant basalt logs that built Nan Madol on Pohnpei. They come from a promontory on the other side of a very mountainous island and the one modern attempt to move a smaller log by raft sank immediately in the harbour when the log was placed upon it.</p>
<p class="indent">As for the suggestion that the Rapa Nui people debased their own environment and were living in a state of near-total social collapse at the time of first European contact, this is one of those historical theories &#x2013; like the Aryan Invasion Theory of India &#x2013; that has been completely dismissed for a lack of evidence but not been replaced with anything else. In the journal <i>Energy and Environment</i> (2005 Vol. 15, Issue 3/4) Benny Peiser, a visiting fellow at the University of Buckingham, observes that &#x2018;there is no compelling archaeological evidence for any of the key claims of societal dissolution and breakdown before the 18th century.&#x2019; Once again, we return to the obligation of proof. Without this, the claim that the moai were part of an ancestor cult that ended just prior to European contact as the Rapa Nui people descended into cannibalism to stave off starvation struggles to find legitimacy. There is no evidence of cannibalism and plenty of evidence of the continuity of the moai-building custom, such as the unfinished statues still in the quarry.</p>
<p class="indent">The population estimates of approximately 2,000 inhabitants at the time of European contact are derived from the best guess of the Dutch explorers during their Easter Sunday visit. What is important to bear in mind is that the Dutch were attempting to count a population they had just opened fire on, having shot dead about a dozen of them following a misunderstanding between the Rapa Nui and the sailors. Counting fleeing or hiding natives when they have the home ground advantage is bound to lead to significant under-reporting.</p>
<p class="indent">So that is no archaeological evidence of social collapse or cultural debasement and an under-reporting of a population at first contact that would then spend the next
<a id="page_101"></a>
century dying of Western diseases and being abducted by Peruvian and European slave traders. By the time accurate records were made by the missionaries, Rapa Nui society really was in a state of collapse. The &#x2018;decline&#x2019; hypothesis arose in the 1970s and 1980s when the likes of Jared Diamond were attempting to sell their racially problematic views of how cultures rise and fall. Shifting the blame from the colonists to Rapa Nui itself provided a neat, hermetic &#x2018;example&#x2019; of the theory. Pity about the facts.</p>
<p class="indent">As you might expect, the indigenous origin story is significantly different. One of the founders of the culture, King Hotu-Matua, came from the island of Hiva, which was sinking. However, Rapa Nui was already inhabited in some accounts. There were two groups of people during the foundational days of the island: the <i>Hanua Eepe</i>, &#x2018;long-eared,&#x2019; and the <i>Hanua Momoku</i>, &#x2018;short-eared.&#x2019; According to Dr Schoch, some versions of these tales have the moai-building culture arriving with the Hanua Eepe, who also enslaved the Hanua Momoku until they one day rose up, cornered the &#x2018;long-eared&#x2019; on one section of the island and killed them all.</p>
<p class="indent">What is commonly left out of a reliance on the population estimates of the Dutch explorers &#x2013; and may have bearing on the suggestion there were two groups on the island &#x2013; is that they also recounted seeing living giants. In the exact words of the explorer C. F. Behrens, &#x2018;&#x2026; with truth, I might say that these savages are all of more than gigantic size. The men are tall and broad in proportion, averaging 12 feet in height. Surprising as it may appear, the tallest men on board of our ship could pass between the legs of these children of Goliath without bending the head. The women can not compare in stature with the men, as they are commonly not above 10 feet high.&#x2019; It is frustrating that mainstream historians can trust the accuracy of one part of their account while completely dismissing the other.</p>
<p class="indent">It does not come into the journey of this book but we should ourselves be slow to dismiss these accounts. The Mound Builder culture of North and South America appears to be anything but a hoax, although it certainly was a cover-up. Abraham Lincoln even mentioned them in speeches. Rapa Nui would be precisely the sort of place you would expect to find a relict survival, just as the diminutive <i>Homo floresiensis</i> &#x2013; a hominin I find even less plausible than giants but nevertheless existed &#x2013; was found on the other side of the Pacific. Interestingly, early European accounts of Indonesia speak of a living race of very small humans, so there may well have been another relict survival into the modern era within the western remains of the Sunda empire.</p>

<p class="h3"><b>RAPA NUI STAR LORE</b></p>
<p class="indent">The official dating of the arrival of the first humans at Rapa Nui &#x2013; between 700 <small>CE</small> and 1100 <small>CE</small> &#x2013; is not based on any genetic data but exclusively on archaeological evidence. If Dr Schoch&#x2019;s analysis of the island is even slightly correct, it is also based on <i>selective</i> archaeological evidence, whilst ignoring the sedimentation around the moai and lack of granite quarries, as either of these would push the date back quite significantly. Another example of this selective evidence would be the reliance on a change from palm to grassland around 1200 <small>CE</small> &#x2013; contiguous with the presumed first arrival of the Polynesians &#x2013; whilst ignoring the same palm-to-grassland change that occurs at 450 <small>BCE</small>.</p>
<p class="indent">It may be the case that 100 <small>CE</small> was indeed when the first people arrived at Rapa Nui. The hypothesis that Polynesian cultures were the most likely to retain elements of the Sunda and Sahul cosmologies remains in play. It is, however, considerably strengthened if it transpires the islands have been, or were once, occupied significantly earlier. The reason for this is Rapa Nuian star lore is astoundingly similar to the emergence of star lore with the first &#x2018;civilisations&#x2019; of the Near East and Indian subcontinent. It has the highest degree of ritual overlap out of anywhere in the Pacific which could be explained by using an earlier date of first settlement, contemporaneous with the proposed influence on points west, after which point in time the Rapa Nuians remained in the most splendid of isolations out of anywhere in Polynesia. We shall return to this suggestion following an analysis of their star lore.</p>
<p class="indent">Rapa Nui provides the best example in the Pacific of the use of astronomy and star lore for reasons other than navigation. It was home to a powerful priesthood who used their knowledge of observation of the stars to set a yearly calendar of ritual and domestic activities. Most of the information regarding the sacred astronomy of this priesthood was collected in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, probably the very last time any of these practices remained in living memory, and sometimes only as remembrances of tales told by grandparents. In fact, a lot of the star lore lay forgotten in dusty boxes in the Royal Geographic Society until 1983, when the unpublished field notes of ethnographer Katherine Routledge&#x2019;s 1914&#x2013;1919 studies were located. She managed to find two elderly inhabitants who could allegedly read some of the mysterious rongorongo script, although their description of the meanings differs markedly.</p>
<p class="indent">Carved onto wooden tablets and seemingly kept in the majority of Rapa Nui homes, this script was only first discovered by Europeans in the 1860s, at which point missionary zeal led to the fiery destruction of most of them. Now only a few dozen remain and many of these are scattered across western museum collections. These
<a id="page_105"></a>
tablets are a couple of centuries old and likely copies of earlier tablets or carvings.</p>
<p class="indent">Currently undeciphered, the rongorongo glyphs repeat in a way that leads some researchers to suggest they are or were sacred chants. But, as we shall see, there is a good case to be made for suggesting these are depictions of stars and sky phenomena. One interpretation does not preclude the other, of course. Indeed, it seems likely they are sacred chants of star lore, which is not at all without precedent across Polynesia.</p>
<p class="indent">Some of the symbols are very similar to glyphs found on other Pacific islands, particularly in Hawaii and Micronesia. Quite suggestively, there is also a stylistic overlap with the also undeciphered Indus script. If these similarities are anything other than accidental, then they may well point to a shared origin, perhaps even a Sundaland one. Even more intriguingly, Dr Schoch sees similarities with both the Nazca Lines and carvings found at G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe. For all of these to have a common origin, we are indeed back in the early days of Southeast Asian colonisation, which is the last time the ancestors of all these cultures were in the one place.</p>
<p class="indent">Returning to Katherine Routledge, she was told there were several classes of astronomer priests, each trained to and then tasked with recording the movements of specific asterisms, principally Orion, the Pleiades and Sirius/Canis Major from certain <i>ahu</i>, or sacred platforms. Although the earliest interpretation of these ahu were that they were aligned to solstices and equinoxes (western antiquarians having a tendency to overemphasise the sun), it turns out that those that <i>do</i> have sky alignments are better matches for the rising of specific constellations. And it is those with stellar alignments that are the best constructed out of all the ahu. Caves and natural rocks were also used as observation points. One promontory on the Poike Peninsula is called <i>Papa ui hetu&#x2019;u</i>, &#x2018;the rock for star-gazing.&#x2019; Near to the promontory was a rock Routledge identified as having a cup hole &#x2018;star map&#x2019; of the Pleiades. Cup holes are common in megalithic sites across Western Europe and also feature on the tops of the T-shaped pillars at G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe.</p>
<p class="indent">Like we find in Western Polynesia, the Eastern Polynesian year began with the rising of the Pleiades, called Matariki. However in the east, they are more explicit about what this entails. During Matariki, the gods descended from the skyworld, <i>ao</i>, to mingle with humans in the realm of the living, called <i>kainga</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">Matariki inaugurated the &#x2018;bountiful season,&#x2019; called <i>Hora Nui</i>. Beginning at this point and proceeding through the year, the ritual marking of the annual cycle was called &#x2018;the Work of the Gods.&#x2019; This calendar was lunar, rather than solar, which is another overlap with early Indian culture. In order of importance, the preeminent asterisms and constellations should be familiar by now.</p>
<a id="page_106"></a>
<p class="h3"><b>Orion</b></p>
<p class="indent">Orion has three separate names in Rapanui star lore. They are <i>Tautoru</i>, the Three Handsome Ones, which are the belt stars; <i>E tui</i>, &#x2018;The Expelled,&#x2019; which is the constellation itself; and <i>Tau ahu</i>, &#x2018;Beautiful Firebrand,&#x2019; the name for Rigel and the wife of one of the belt stars. Along with the Pleiades, Orion&#x2019;s Belt was the most important asterism.</p>
<p class="indent">Immediately following the first lunar month of <i>Hora Nui</i>, marked by the Pleiades&#x2019; arrival into the sky, was the lunar month of Ruti, where Orion&#x2019;s Belt was high in the sky and rituals were held to honour the chiefs and ancestors. The next three months deal principally with the location of the Pleiades and Orion&#x2019;s Belt in the sky and their relationship to Mars, Canopus and other important stellar objects. The month of Tara Hau, when the Pleiades disappeared beneath the horizon, signalled a time of calamity for man until the next Matariki festival in several months&#x2019; time. Again, this is curiously redolent of Ancient Egypt.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>Other Important Stars</b></p>
<p class="indent">Other stars, planets and constellations of significance recur. Chief among them are Sirius, <i>Te pou o te rangi</i>, the Post of the Sky; Canopus, <i>Po roroa</i>, the Great Darkness, used in conjunction with Orion&#x2019;s Belt to time the planting season; Mars, <i>Matamea</i>, Red Eye, observed from Routledge&#x2019;s observatory on Poike and probably considered a bad omen. Vega, Antares, Alpha Centauri, Beta Centauri, Venus and Aldebaran were all named, tracked and calendarised in the &#x2018;Work of the Gods.&#x2019;</p>
<p class="h3"><b>Other Ritual Activity</b></p>
<p class="indent">Turmeric, which is native to southeast India, was made into a body paint called <i>renga</i> during the Matariki festival. Offerings of turmeric were also made to the high chief. If this is not an historical development &#x2013; which is unlikely &#x2013; then we are left to wonder how a member of the Indian ginger family ended up on the most isolated island on earth, more than half a world away.</p>
<p class="indent">Rapa Nui&#x2019;s astronomer-priests were known as <i>tohunga</i>. The exact same word in Maori means expert or wise man, equivalent to the Hawaiian <i>kahuna</i>. In New Zealand there were tohunga specialising in navigation, medicine, stars, canoe building and so on. On Rapa Nui, it was the tohunga who read the sacred chants of the rongorongo script. According to what Katherine Routledge was told, these tohunga lived in circular stone towers called <i>tupa</i>. The majority of these tupa are clustered in the northern part of the island, where we also find &#x2018;the rock for star-gazing&#x2019; and plenty of ahu. A 2010 Explorers Club Flag Expedition to Rapa Nui found that all but one of these tupa had entranceways that were oriented to a star or asterism in some way involved in the
<a id="page_107"></a>
&#x2018;Work of the Gods.&#x2019; It may be that measurements were taken when the stars appeared in the doorway or it may even have been a way of drawing down a particular asterism into its tower. Again we immediately think of Egypt.</p>
<p class="h3"><b>GATHERING UP THE STARS</b></p>
<p class="indent">What are we to make of Rapa Nui, then? It is apparently the last island in Polynesia to have been colonised, as recently as only a thousand or fifteen hundred years ago. Yet it has geological, archaeological and potentially ritual evidence to suggest activity in much earlier times. Rapa Nui may have been an outpost of the Nusantao Maritime Trading Network that arose immediately after the end of the Ice Age. Or it may have even been a holy island that was not permanently occupied and used as a sacred or holy site, both before and after this point. Perhaps it was a combination of sacred site and sailing stop-off point, never permanently occupied and visited at intervals determined by the stars and the seasons, such as was the case with G&#x00F6;bekli Tepe. One of the names for the island means &#x2018;navel of the world,&#x2019; hinting it may have had a ritual value far in excess of its comparatively meagre resource value.</p>
<p class="indent">If such a scenario is accurate, it provides a &#x2018;solve&#x2019; for the otherwise incongruous data suggesting both very early and very late occupation: it was a site that was used and known during a time when the sea levels were much lower, then it was abandoned or the original inhabitants died out. Then it was recolonised by the descendants of these first occupiers in the first millennium <small>CE</small> and some of the remaining megalithic infrastructure, such as the basalt moai, were repurposed.</p>
<p class="indent">Whatever the scenario, the island is the most challenging and most rewarding place to look for where, in the words of Dr Oppenheimer that open this chapter, survivors of a sunken landmass may have &#x2018;retained their original culture with the least dilution.&#x2019;</p>
<p class="indent">Right across Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia we have the demonstrable continuity of Gondwana star lore being developed into a highly sophisticated form of Laurasian astronomical knowledge used for navigation and the precise measurement of a ritual year. We find the Gondwana/Laurasia crossover of star lore in the same part of the world &#x2013; Sunda and Sahul land &#x2013; where linguistic evidence records the first rise in cultural complexity since we left Africa, which also seems to have stepped, pyramidal hills built before the end of the Ice Age. This part of the world also has genetic, archaeological and potentially linguistic links to the &#x2018;first cilivisations&#x2019; of Harappa, Sumer and Egypt, as well as probably South America (although we are now heading in the opposite direction).</p>
<p class="indent">Over the last one hundred and fifty years, historians have looked for singular, linear answers: cities started <i>here</i>. The people next door learned from them and then built
<a id="page_108"></a>
cities. Pyramids started <i>there</i> and then their neighbours copied the form. This linearity simply does not match what we now know about early human population movements or the &#x2018;overlap analysis&#x2019; of world mythology that points to much, much older shared origins of specific gods and cosmologies. This book does not suggest that all culture and civilisation came from the scattered survivors of Sundaland, setting out in ships to become the world&#x2019;s wisdom teachers. It seems increasingly clear that early communities across Eurasia had hugely sophisticated cosmologies and even architectural capacities by the end of the Ice Age, the original elements of which they may have brought with them as human populations moved up into Eurasia and Europe from South Asia during a brief warm period as the mtDNA evidence suggests. Instead, this book suggests that survivors of the sinking of Sunda and Sahul brought technological and <i>magical</i> techniques with them to populations across central and western Asia that were already <i>in situ</i> and likely even had vaguely recognisable pantheons and practices. It is also fairly likely that the Sunda survivors knew of these scattered communities if the evidence for transoceanic and transcontinental trade is considered.</p>
<p class="indent">Moving from Wendy Doniger&#x2019;s microscope back to her telescope, we find in the star lore of the Pacific a concept of divine kingship descending from the night sky, the magic of immortality and human origin associated with particular asterisms and the belief that actions or architecture &#x2018;below&#x2019; are in some way aligned with that which is &#x2018;above.&#x2019;</p>
<p class="indent">Even more than that, we have specific asterisms such as Orion and even god names that recur in both description and magical function for the next five thousand years. We can now posit that creating a map or replica with specific points in the night sky, a concept we see executed throughout dynastic Egypt and continuing into the hermetic traditions of the Classical Age, seems to be a very long-lived one. The development of this star map with ever more precision is, I believe, the &#x2018;wisdom of the sages come down to us from a time before the Flood,&#x2019; as it is commonly described. It grew in a highly specific incubator: the interactions with the spirit world conducted by a culture or cultures of highly proficient open ocean navigators for whom precision was a literal matter of life and death. And the proof of their supreme competence is the very fact of the existence of their descendants living on every piece of habitable land in the Pacific, an ocean which covers half our planet&#x2019;s surface.</p>
<p class="indent">It must have been quite an event to set these ancient Argonauts on such a journey.</p>
